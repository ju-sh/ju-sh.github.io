Mary: That's enough.<br />
Mary: No one's adopted.<br />
Missy: I wish I was.<br />
Mary: That can still be arranged.</p>

trust?<br />

Meemaw: That's what makes life interesting.</p>

Sheldon: All right.<br />
George: So, today we found out about a school in Dallas for really smart
kids.<br />
Sheldon: When can I start?<br />
Mary: Hold on. Dallas is far away, so you'd have to live with another
family.<br />
Sheldon: Do they have a dog?<br />
Mary: Uh, we don't know.<br />
Sheldon: Well, can you make some calls?<br />
Mary: I guess, but wouldn't you miss your mom and dad?<br />
Sheldon: Oh… Yes, I suppose I will.<br />
Sheldon: So, when are you calling about the dog?<br />
Meemaw: You know him so well.</p>

Georgie: Soon as I graduate high school, I'm gonna be a professional
male model.<br />

Dallas:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Meemaw: I got you a little going away gift. Come on in.<br />
Meemaw: This necklace has been in our family for generations.<br />
Meemaw: It belonged to a Comanche warrior who gave it to your
great-great-great-great grandma.<br />
Sheldon: Why'd he give it to her?<br />
Meemaw: Well, according to family lore, she was, uh, a very
accommodating young lady and, uh, they hit it off.<br />
Sheldon: That's a bird feather.<br />
Meemaw: Eagle feather.<br />
Sheldon: Doesn't matter. I don't like birds, birds are filthy.<br />
Meemaw: Okay. Fine.<br />
(Meemaw removes the feather from the gift)<br />
Meemaw: One featherless family heirloom for you to take with you and
keep you safe while you're away.<br />
Sheldon: You don't actually believe this has magic powers, do you?<br />
Meemaw: Oh, for God's sake, just say "thank you."<br />
Sheldon: Thank you.<br />
Meemaw: (Chuckles) Mmm.<br />
There's a price tag on it.<br />
Meemaw: (Ripping away the price tag) No, there's not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Missy: You awake?<br />
Sheldon: Yes.<br />
Missy: Are you gonna miss me?<br />
Sheldon: I haven't given it any thought.<br />
Missy: Well, were're just lying here. Think about it<br />
Sheldon: I'm used to you.<br />
Missy: I'm used to you too.<br />
Sheldon: It's not the same as liking you.<br />
Missy: No.<br />
Sheldon: To me, you're like string beans. No one asks for them, no one
wonders about them. They're just there on the plate.<br />
Missy: But you eat them, right?<br />
Sheldon: Yes.<br />
Missy: (Smiling) You're gonna miss me.<br />
…<br />
…<br />
…<br />
(Some time later, when having dinner away from home)<br />
Flora: Do you like string beans?<br />
Sheldon: No.<br />
Sheldon: But I eat them.<br />
…<br />
…<br />
(Missy before sleeping, with her eyes closed)<br />
Missy: Sheldon, can you hear me?<br />
Missy: It's your twin sister, Missy.<br />
(George listens outside the door.)<br />
Missy: Everything's all right here, but I think Mom misses you real
bad.<br />
(Opens eyes and looks at Sheldon's bed in her room. Closes eyes
again.)<br />
Missy: (Sighs) All right, I can't hear you, so I'm gonna hang up
now.<br />
Missy: Good night.<br />
(George leaves and sees that Mary and Meemaw are missing Sheldon as
well.)<br />
…<br />
…<br />
…<br />
(The morning after George brings Sheldon back upon seeing that everyone
misses him, Missy waking up and sees Sheldon in his bed.)<br />
Missy: You got my message!<br />
(Sheldon wakes up and looks at her.)<br />
Missy: (Leaping upon Sheldon) Hi-yah!<br />
Sheldon: No hugging! No hugging!<br />
(Missy laughs.)</p>

Flora: Uh, we don't do that in our house.<br />
Sheldon: Oh.<br />
Flora: But you're welcome to do so.<br />
Sheldon: That's all right. I don't believe in God.<br />
Elliot: Well, then why would you say grace?<br />
Sheldon: Because it makes my mom happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>s1e10: Meemaw and Mary talking about Sheldon being away:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary: What? You thought him leaving was a good idea.<br />
Meemaw: Oh, I only said that because you thought it was a bad
idea.<br />
Meemaw: You know how it's always my nature to go the other way.<br />
Meemaw: Say "up."<br />
Mary: Up.<br />
Meemaw: Down.</p>

<p>Herschel: Hey, George. Uh, you didn't see a dog wandering around
here, did you?<br />
George: No. Y'all get a dog?<br />

<blockquote>
<p>Mary: There is a tornado watch. Let's go!<br />
Meemaw: Oh, come on, Mary. We've had a watch every day for two
months.<br />
Meemaw: Nothing ever happens.<br />
Sheldon: I think you're just worried I'm earning the money to send in my
college application.<br />
Mary: I am worried it is not safe out here. Let's go!<br />
Sheldon: I can worry about my own safety, thank you.<br />
Mary: I don't care if you think you're an adult.<br />
Mary: I'm your mother, and you will do as I say.<br />
(Siren blaring in distance.)<br />
Meemaw: Well, that ain't good.<br />
Mary: You believe me now?<br />
(Sheldon shakes his head fearfully.)<br />
…<br />
…<br />
(After the tornado is over.)<br />

<ul>
<li>s02e03: Sheldon helping his mother when he is losing faith in God
after hearing of the death of a teenager.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sheldon: Can I sit with you?<br />
Mary: I think Mommy needs to be alone right now.<br />
Sheldon: All right.<br />
(Sheldon starts to leave, looks back at Mary with his hand on the
door.)<br />
(Meanwhile, Mary sighs looking in front of her.)<br />
(Sheldon turns back to his mother.)<br />
Sheldon: Mom, I'm scared.<br />
Mary: Why?<br />
Sheldon: You didn't go to church, you stopped saying grace. I don't
understand what's going on.<br />
(Mary sighs.)<br />
Mary: It's kind of hard to explain.<br />
Is it me? Did I do something wrong?<br />
Mary: (Worried) Of course not.<br />
Mary: (Patting on the chair) Come here.<br />
(Sheldon seats himself besides his mother.)<br />
Mary: Sheldon…<br />
Mary: (Sighing) Faith means believing in something you can't know for
sure is real.<br />
Mary: (Sighing) And right now, I am struggling with that.<br />
Sheldon: So you don't believe in God anymore?<br />
Mary: That isn't something for you to worry about.<br />
Mary: I need to figure this out myself.<br />
Sheldon: Can I help? Maybe I could provide a fresh perspective.<br />
Mary: I don't think so, baby.<br />
Sheldon: Did you know that if gravity were slightly more powerful, the
universe would collapse into a ball?<br />
Mary: I did not.<br />
Sheldon: Also, if gravity were slightly less powerful, the universe
would fly apart and there would be no stars or planets.<br />
Mary: Where you going with this, Sheldon?<br />
Sheldon: It's just that gravity is precisely as strong as it needs to
be.<br />
Sheldon: And if the ratio of the electromagnetic force to the strong
force wasn't one percent, life wouldn't exist.<br />
Sheldon: What are the odds that would happen all by itself?<br />
Mary: Why are you trying to convince me to believe in God?<br />
Mary: You don't believe in God.<br />
Sheldon: I don't, but the precision of the universe at least makes it
logical to conclude there's a creator.<br />
(Mary sighs.)<br />
Mary: Baby, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but…<br />
Mary: (Pointing to her head) logic is here.<br />
Mary: (Pointing to her heart) And my problem is here.<br />
Sheldon: Well, there are five billion people on this planet and you're
the perfect mom for me.<br />
Sheldon: What are the odds of that?<br />
Mary: Oh.<br />
(Mary hugs Sheldon.)<br />
Mary: Thank you, Lord, for this little boy.<br />
Sheldon: I knew I could fix it.<br />
(Mary laughs.)<br />
Mary: Maybe it was you and the Lord.</p>

<ul>
<li>s02e03: Sheldon finding inconsistencies in the Bible during the
pastor's sermon:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Pastor: And Jacob said: "For I have seen God face to face, and my
life is preserved."<br />
Sheldon: (Whispering) Is this an appropriate time to mention that John
1:18 says, "No man hath seen God at any time."?<br />
Sheldon: Who's right? Jacob or John?<br />
Mary: Let's talk about it in the car.<br />
(Meemaw raises her hand.)<br />
Pastor: .. the Lord. Yes, Connie?<br />
Meemaw: My grandson has a question.<br />
(Pastor sighs.)<br />
Meemaw: (looking at Sheldon) Let 'er rip, kid.<br />
(Meemaw turns back and grins at the pastor.)</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sheldon: Mom, I was going through our expenditures and noticed our
grocery bills are up 12% compared to last quarter.<br />
Sheldon: Any idea why?<br />
George: (Meaning Meemaw) There's a person at the end of the table that
eats for free.<br />
Meemaw: There's a person at the other end of the table that eats for
three.</p>

Mary:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>George: Hey. Hey, hey, hey.<br />
George: What do you say we keep this quiet?<br />
Sheldon: You mean like a secret?<br />
George: No, no, just, you know, something between you and me.<br />
Sheldon: What about Mom?<br />
George: Mom is on a need-to-know basis.<br />
Sheldon: What if Mom needs to know?<br />
George: Okay, it's a secret.</p>

missing cheque business unknown to Mary:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>George: Why don't we just come clean?<br />
Meemaw: All right, sure, we could do that.<br />
Meemaw: You could rat me out to Mary and…<br />
Meemaw: I could tell her what you did at the church picnic.<br />
George: Come on.<br />
George: Now you're just playing dirty.<br />
Meemaw: We sink or swim together, George.<br />
Meemaw: We sink or swim together.<br />
George: Grandmas are supposed to be nice.<br />

them with the utmost courtesy.<br />
Sheldon: The Vietnamese are a very welcoming people.<br />
Tam: Yeah, that hasn't always worked out for us.</p>

<li>s02e04: Mary finally learning the secret:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>George: Hey.<br />
Mary: What's up?<br />
George: Um, I need to tell you something.<br />
Mary: What did you do?<br />
George: When Sheldon was doing our taxes, he noticed a missing
check.<br />
Mary: What did you do?<br />
George: Before I answer, do you trust me enough to understand it was for
a good reason and j-just leave it at that?<br />
Mary: What did you do?<br />
George: It's all your mother's fault. She is a bad person. I've been
telling you for years.<br />
Mary: (With Meemaw) What did you do?<br />
Meemaw: Okay, now, before I answer that…<br />
Mary: Just tell me what you did.<br />
Meemaw: I got a DWI.<br />
Mary: Mom!<br />
Meemaw: It's not as bad as it sounds.<br />
Mary: How is driving drunk not bad?<br />
Meemaw: I wasn't exactly driving.<br />
Mary: I don't follow.<br />
Meemaw: I was at the dog track with Georgie, and I had a few…<br />
Mary: Georgie?!<br />
(Cut to Georgie.)<br />
Georgie: With God as my witness, I've never been to the dog track in my
life.<br />
Meemaw: (Out of the corner of her mouth.) She knows.<br />
Georgie: Oh, I've been there a bunch.<br />
Mary: Will someone please tell me what happened?<br />
Georgie: Okay, me and Meemaw were in the bar at the track…<br />
Mary: You took him to a bar?<br />
Meemaw: He wasn't drinking.<br />
Georgie: She had a few too many margaritas, so I drove us home.<br />
Mary: But you don't have a license.<br />
Georgie: That's why we swapped places after the cop pulled us
over.<br />
Mary: Dear Lord.<br />
George: I had nothing to do with this part.<br />
Mary: Shut up.<br />
George: Will do.<br />
Meemaw: I didn't want Georgie to get into trouble, so I got behind the
wheel before the cop walked up.<br />
Meemaw: And then I got arrested, and,<br />
Meemaw: (Pointing to George) he bailed me out.<br />
Mary: So you all thought you should keep this from me?<br />
Absolutely.<br />
100%.<br />
Georgie: Yes.<br />
Mary: Okay, here's what's gonna happen. You and you are staying at her
house until I say otherwise.<br />
Georgie: One could argue I was the hero in this story.<br />
Mary: You went gambling and you drove without a license and you lied to
my face.<br />
Georgie: Heroically.<br />
Mary: Go!<br />
(Camera focuses on Missy and Sheldon standing nearby.)<br />

</ul>

<p>Mary: Oh, who do you think you're fooling here?<br />
Georgie: I have no idea what you're talking about.<br />
Mary: Listen to me. Veronica has a rough family situation, and she's
trying to improve her life.<br />
Georgie: And I admire that. Very inspirational.<br />
Mary: Georgie, believe me, I'm glad to see you in a church, but I do not
want you taking advantage of that girl.<br />
Georgie: Taking advantage? Veronica and I are Bible buddies, nothing
more.<br />
Georgie: I'm serious.<br />
Mary: Right.<br />
Georgie: Maybe you should ask yourself what's in you that makes you see
sin in the hearts of others.<br />
Mary: Okay, now you're pushing it.<br />
Georgie: Lord Jesus, please help my mother with her anger.<br />
Georgie: Can I get an amen?<br />
Mary: No!</p>

<li>s02e06:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sheldon: Actually, fear has been a recruiting tactic used by
organized religion for centuries.<br />
Sheldon: When you add guilt to keep people in line, it's an extremely
efficient form of crowd control.<br />
Mary: Our religion is based on love, Sheldon, not fear.<br />
Sheldon: So what happens when people don't follow the rules?<br />
Mary: They burn in hell.<br />
(Others look suprised.)<br />
Mary: Because God loves 'em.</p>

<li>s02e06: Mary worried about the Church's Halloween event:</li>
</ul>

<p>Mary: I can't believe this.<br />
George: No good?<br />
Mary: It's awful. It makes sin seem like a good thing.<br />
George: Well, that's the problem, isn't it?<br />
George: I mean, if sin didn't seem like a good thing, nobody would do
it.<br />
George, please, I'm in no mood.<br />
George: Hey. Wrath.<br />
George: That's one of the seven sins, right?<br />
Mary: Pastor Jeff gave me this project because he knew I'd be best at
it.<br />
Mary: Now Gene… Lundy is taking over.<br />
George: Oh, look, pride. And envy.<br />
George: Don't stop. Four sins to go.<br />
(Annoyed, Mary looks at George.)<br />
George: I'm guessing lust ain't happening tonight.</p>

<p>Narrator: Mr. Lundy's scene about lust made a deep impact on my
brother's date.<br />
Narrator: She asked to be saved by Jesus.<br />
Narrator: And as it turns out, she was.<br />
Narrator: She went on to live a life devoted to God, feeding the poor,
even helping her sister start a literacy program for female
prisoners.<br />
Narrator: My brother, on the other hand, became a devout atheist after
that night.</p>

our electricity problem.<br />
Mary: Not now, Sheldon.<br />
George: I wouldn't mind hearing it.<br />
Mary: Who?<br />
Missy: If you want, I'll ask around.<br />
…<br />
…<br />
Mary: Just tell me her name.<br />
George: It's not important. It was a long time ago.<br />
Mary: Then how come I don't know about it?<br />

Mary: If that's so, why'd this mystery woman break your heart?<br />
George: Come on, Mare. We were young. We were kids. Leave it
alone.<br />
Mary: Just tell me her name, and I'll drop it forever.<br />

Georgie: Not far enough, but it'll have to do.<br />
George: Look, Georgie, I know it feels bad right now, but…<br />
George: I promise it'll get better.<br />
…<br />
Georgie: How's it gonna get better? Veronica thinks I'm a jerk, and
everyone in the school's calling me Lovey Cooper.<br />
George: Ooh, that is not a good name.<br />
Georgie: It doesn't matter, 'cause I'm never going back to that
school.<br />
George: Listen to me.<br />
George: Hey. You're a good-looking kid, and you got a big heart.<br />
George: Once we get you on a daily shower schedule, the girls are gonna
be lining up.<br />
Georgie: I don't want girls. I want Veronica.<br />
George: Yeah, maybe you'll get her and maybe you won't. But someday,
you'll find the woman who was really meant for you.<br />
Mary: (Passing by the door with a basket) You mean like Kathryn
Dempsey?<br />
George: Alaska's beautiful. How 'bout I go with you?<br />
Georgie: Who's Kathryn Dempsey?<br />
George: I was 15 years…<br />
George: (Louder so that Mary can hear) I was 15 years old!</p>

sitting next to me is.<br />

respect the sanctity of my body.<br />

Mary: You know what? Maybe you should mention the blindfold and mittens
to the doctor.<br />
Sheldon: Or maybe I'll mention how you think that God speaks to you,

Mary: So naturally I was concerned about his well-being and was keeping

Sheldon: It's called being neurotic.<br />
Mary: It's called being a good mother.<br />
Therapist: This is healthy. Communication is the cornerstone…<br />
Sheldon: I am behaving no differently than I ever have. Why are you
suddenly so worried about me?<br />
Therapist: That is a valid question. Has anything changed
recently?<br />
Mary: Well…<br />
Sheldon: Maybe it's hormonal. When does menopause typically begin?<br />
Mary: It is not my hormones.<br />
Sheldon: Well, it certainly isn't mine. I'm showing no signs of

That's what I'll be doing today.<br />
If it weren't for this person, I wouldn't be here right now.<br />
(Meemaw looking happy.)<br />
They've taught me a lot,<br />
(Mary looking happy.)<br />
and it's by their example that I found the courage to move forward into
this new and exciting chapter of my life.<br />
(George looking happy.)<br />
Missy…<br />
This is for you.<br />
(Missy looks overjoyed.)<br />
Change can be scary, but I know we're going to be fine…<br />
Because like you said,<br />
"It's okay to be scared. We just have to do it anyway."<br />
(Meemaw glances at Missy, who is watching Sheldon talking to her before
glancing at Meemaw as well.)<br />
So if any of my fellow graduates are nervous about the future, know that
you're not alone.<br />
I suggest you all try to be as brave as my twin sister.<br />
That's my plan.<br />
(Missy laughs slightly and looks to her right.)<br />
Missy,<br />
(Missy turns back to look at Sheldon.)<br />
I wish I could give you advice about middle school, but I was so smart,
I skipped it.<br />
If you make it to high school, we'll talk.<br />
(Missy shakes her head, rolling her eyes.)<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Narrator: The following day,<br />
(Missy and her classmates performing an action song on stage with
Sheldon and his parents among the audience.)<br />
Narrator: I attended my sister's elementary school graduation.<br />
(Mary and George smiling, Sheldon straight-faced.)<br />
Narrator: She didn't deliver a speech to me, but she did make eye
contact<br />
(Missy looks at Sheldon, smiling. The action at the time looks as if she
is waving at him.)<br />
while she sang "This land is your land".<br />
(Sheldon's face has some trace of a smile.)<br />

Georgie: Then how'd you know his name's Dalton?<br />
Mary: I don't have to explain myself to you.<br />
Georgie: This is a pretty dirty movie.<br />
Mary: How do you know? It is rated R.<br />
Georgie: For violence, language, and sexual content. You should be
ashamed of yourself.<br />
…<br />

Georgie: Now, how many times have you seen Road House?<br />
Mary: Sorry, can't hear you.<br />
Georgie: More or less than five? 'Cause that's how many times I've seen
it.<br />
Mary: That's how many years you're gonna be grounded if you don't drop
it right now.<br />
Georgie: Does Dad know you like this movie?<br />
[vacuum stops]<br />
Mary: No. And it is going to stay that way.<br />
Georgie: Why?<br />
Mary: Because it is not something I should be watching.<br />
Georgie: Then why are you watching it?<br />
[exhales]<br />
Mary: It is a guilty pleasure. So would you drop it now?<br />
