<h2 id="malcolm-in-the-middle">Malcolm in the middle:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Malcolm and Resse getting yelled at by their mother:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Malcolm: But Mom!<br />
You and your brother are not to leave this room.<br />
(Reese is mocking his mother by imitating her behind her back.)<br />
I don't want to see you. I don't want to hear you. I don't want to so
much as sense your presence.<br />
(Lois looks at the mirror and happens to see what Reese is doing without
him realizing it.)<br />
Lois: For crying out loud, Reese, there's a mirror right there!<br />
(Reese is fearfully surprised, looks at the mirror and realizes that
Lois was seeing what he was doing.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lois and the new neighbour arguing:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Where is he supposed to look? You got them laid out like a couple of
eggs on a plate!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dewey hiding when his parents are going to take him to
hospital:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh.. Poor little thing…<br />
(Puts her finger on top of the straw to cut off his air supply.)<br />
Lois: (to her husband) Go start the car.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>After Hal barely fit the car in the garage:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Hal: I think you owe me an apology.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reese arguing with his mother, being excited about becoming a cop in
future:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Reese: What are you doing?<br />
Lois: Unloading the groceries.<br />
Reese: You are.. a little far on the sidewalk, aren't you?<br />
Lois: Who cares? Grab my bag.<br />
Reese: You have to leave the sidewalk free for pedestrians.<br />
Lois: Stop stalling and help unload.<br />
Reese: Are you walking away from me?<br />
Lois: Excuse me?<br />
Reese: You can't leave your car here.<br />
Lois: I will leave my car wherever I wanna leave my car.<br />
Reese: Well, I'd hate to see anything happen to your car.<br />
Lois: Just bring in the bags, Reese.<br />
Reese: Officer in need of assistance! Repeat. Officer in need of
assistance!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Malcolm in the middle:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Lois: No playing ball ON the house.<br />
Lois: No playing ball <em>through</em> the house.<br />
Reese: This isn't even fun.<br />
Malcolm: That stopped being the point a long time ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lois shouting when Malcolm and Reese are playing ball inside the
house:</li>
</ul>
<p>Lois: Malcolm, Reese. No ball playing in the house.<br />
(Cut to Malcolm and Reese playing ball on the roof.)<br />
Lois: No playing ball ON the house!</p>
<p>Malcolm is standing outside. He tosses the ball in through the
window. It goes through the living room and the kitchen, and out the
door on the other side of the house, where Reese catches it. Lois: No
playing ball THROUGH the house. (Cut to Malcolm and Reese each with
their upper body out of a window, tossing the ball with their feet
inside the house but the ball technically outside.) Reese: This isn't
even fun. Malcolm: That stopped being the point a long time ago.</p>
<p>Malcolm: So according to your logic, a two foot fall from a mini bike
is more dangerous than a 6 foot fall from a galloping horse?<br />
Lois: That was a long time ago.<br />
Malcolm: Before.. gravity?</p>
<ul>
<li>When Reese is being chased by a host of police vehicles after
hijacking his driving school's car:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Lois: Just get him on the phone and let me handle this and the only
one who knows how.<br />
Cop: Trust me, we have this under control.<br />
Lois: Don't think I don't know what's gonna happen. You're gonna do your
standard police thing and my son is going to killed in a hell of a gun
fire.<br />
Cop: Ma'am, that almost never happens.<br />
Lois: Just. get. him on the phone!<br />
(Cop looks intimidated.)<br />
[Cut to Lois speaking on phone]<br />
Lois: And you tell him that if he ever wants to see daylight again he
will pull over this instant!<br />
[Cut to Reese driving]<br />
Police via loudspeaker: Your mother wants you to know that she loves you
and ..<br />
Lois: .. he has 10 seconds to pull over that damn car or I'll<br />
Police via loudspeaker: ..and gives you lots of hugs and kisses.<br />
Friend: You heard your Mom. We aren't in trouble.<br />
Friend: (In a bleak voice) Can you pull over now?<br />
Reese: That's <em>not</em> my Mom.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hal and Lois are in the kitchen. Hal is reading Reese's report
card:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Lois: What are you looking at?<br />
Hal: Reese's report card, it is much better than last time.<br />
Lois: Really?<br />
Hal: Yeah, this time he used the exact same brand of pen as the teacher
to change his grade.<br />
Lois: Look at that. He gave himself a C in Maths! Seven A+.<br />
Hal: Yeah, that's subtle. Nice attention to detail. He's really
learning.<br />
(Hal turns to Lois)<br />
Hal: Two months grounded?<br />
Lois: Three months. Scrubbing toilets.</p>

<p>Darling: Listen! Our guns have stopped.<br />
George: You don't think…?<br />
Baldrick: Maybe the war's over. Maybe it's peace!<br />
George: Well, hurrah! The big knobs have gone round the table and yanked
the iron out of the fire!<br />
Darling: Thank God! We lived through it! The Great War: 1914-1917.<br />
George: Hip hip!<br />
All but Edmund: Hurray!<br />
Edmund: (loading his revolver) I'm afraid not. The guns have stopped
because we're about to attack. Not even our generals are mad enough to
shell their own men. They think it's far more sporting to let the
Germans do it.<br />
George: So we are, in fact, going over. This is, as they say, it.<br />
Edmund: I'm afraid so, unless I think of something very quickly.<br />
Voice: Company, one pace forward!<br />
(Everyone steps forward)<br />
Baldrick: Ooh, there's a nasty splinter on that ladder, sir! A bloke
could hurt himself on that.<br />
Voice: Stand ready!<br />
(Everyone puts a foot forward)<br />
Baldrick: I have a plan, sir.<br />
Edmund: Really, Baldrick? A cunning and subtle one?<br />
Baldrick: Yes, sir.<br />
Edmund: As cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of
Cunning at Oxford University?<br />
Baldrick: Yes, sir.<br />
Edmund: Well, I'm afraid it'll have to wait. Whatever it was, I'm sure
it was better than my plan to get out of this by pretending to be mad. I
mean, <strong>who would have noticed another madman around
here</strong>?<br />
(Whistle blows)<br />
Edmund: <strong>Good luck, everyone</strong>. (blows his whistle)</p>
<p>(Everyone yells as they go over the top. German guns fire before
they're even off the ladders.</p>
<p>The scene changes to slow motion, and explosions happen all around
them.<br />
[An echoed piano slowly plays the Blackadder theme.]<br />
The smoke and flying earth begins to obscure vision as the view changes
to the battlefield moments later: empty and silent with barbed wire,
guns and bodies strewn across it.<br />
[A bass drum beats slowly.]<br />
That view in turn changes to the same field as it is today: overgrown
with grasses and flowers, peaceful, with chirping birds.)</p>

Mr. Fawlty: She saw you with the money!<br />
Polly: What?<br />
Mr. Fawlty: She saw you counting the horse money!<br />
Mr. Fawlty: She's just coming…<br />
Mr. Fawlty: Oh, hello, dear. Here she is. Found her in here.<br />
Mr. Fawlty: As I was just saying, Polly,my wife would like a word with
you about a slightly delicate matter.<br />
Mrs. Fawlty: It's not delicate, Basil. Don't be silly.<br />
Mrs. Fawlty: He thinks it's embarrassing for me to ask you about that
money I saw you with earlier on in the office.<br />
Mrs. Fawlty: I wondered if someone had handed it in. Mrs Richards has
lost some.<br />
Polly: The money? In the office?<br />
Mrs. Fawlty: You were counting it, weren't you? Did someone hand it
in?<br />
Polly: Oh, no. No, it's mine.<br />

Mrs. Fawlty: You won it?<br />
Polly: On the horse Mr Fawlty got a tip on. I hope you don't mind,
I…<br />
Mr. Fawlty: No, no, not at all.<br />
Mrs. Fawlty: I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly.<br />
Polly: Oh, I don't. Only I was in the town,and I passed the betting
shop,and I thought, "Well, why not?"<br />
Mr. Fawlty: Well, why not indeed? Jolly good question, eh, dear?<br />
