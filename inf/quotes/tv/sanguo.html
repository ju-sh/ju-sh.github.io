<li>Cao Cao after killing Lu Boshe:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Cao Mengde!<br />
Lu Boshe was our savior and a honorable man!<br />
Correct. (对)<br />
He's also your father's sworn brother and your uncle!<br />
Correct. (对)<br />
We have already killed a dozen of his family members by mistake. Why did
you have to kill Lu Boshe as well?<br />
Precisely because they are already killed innocent people by mistake. We
can't leave him alive.<br />
What are you saying?<br />
Think about it. If Lu Boshe went home and so that we had slaughtered his
entire household, how shocked and furious would he be? wouldn't he then
bring others to hunt us down? Only by killing him will we avoid future
trouble.<br />
You! Oh, Cao Mengde.. you ingrate, killing while knowing it's wrong..
Can you still claim to be a loyal and honorable man?<br />
I would rather betray the world, than let the world betray me.<br />
What did you say?<br />
<strong>I would rather betray the world, than let the world betray
me.</strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>(Later, it starts to rain.)<br />
Cao Cao: Brother Gongtai, it looks like we will have to go back.<br />
Chen Gong: Go back where?<br />
Cao Cao: Chenggao county.<br />
Chen Gong: Why?<br />
Cao Cao: It's a few hundred miles between here and Chenliu. We haven't
eaten for two full days. if we keep walking like this, we will die of
cold and hunger.<br />
Chen Gong: And here I was thinking that you found your conscience and
that you were going to go back to bury Lu Boshe and his family.<br />
Cao Cao: Brother Gongtai, no need to get emotional. <strong>The dead
cannot be brought back to life, yet those who live still shoulder a
great burden.</strong> He had already prepared thanks to eat and drink.
If we don't go back, would he not have died in vain? Let's go.</p>
<p>(Back at Lu Boshe's house.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao:<br />
Uncle, it wasn't I who killed you. It was this era of chaos that
did.<br />
Your kindness to us, your benevolence. I will remember these for as long
as I live. How I will miss you!<br />
O calamity, o woe! O woe, o calamity!</p>
<p>Chen Gong: First you kill a man, and then you mourn him. Your
shamelessness is unheard of.<br />
Cao Cao: Uncle, I promise to avenge this injustice done to you. I will
rally the righteous to overthrow the traitor, and erase iniquity from
the realm. When I've come into my own, I shall give you a plaque of
honour, and grant you a rank among the nobility, so that your soul in
heaven may receive sacrificial offerings for ever.<br />
Chen Gong: You don't sound much like a fugitive on the run. More like
the emperor of tomorrow.<br />
(Cao Cao laughs.)<br />
Cao Cao: Brother Gongtai, the heart of man is unfathomable. none can
predict what is to come. who knows what the future may bring?<br />
…<br />
…<br />
Cao Cao: What are you thinking about?<br />
Chen Gong: I'm thinking about those crickets of mine. they were at least
faithful and honourable.</p>
<p>(Cao Cao laughs.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao:<br />
And yet to abandoned them and ran off with me. Why is that? Doesn't it
mean that I am superior to those crickets?<br />
So that's why I say, <strong>in an era of chaos, only those superior in
strength can talk about faithfulness and honour. The weak will only be
abandoned.</strong></p>
<p>(Cao Cao laughs.)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Chen Gong: At first I thought you were a hero. So I risked my life,
left my family and my rank behind to follow you. To this day, I still
can't tell if you are righteous man or a cunning scoundrel.</p>
<p>(Cao Cao laughs.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao:<br />
Brother Gongtai, the greatest traitor has always resembled an honest man
and the greatest falsehood come across the truth. Righteousness and evil
can not be discerned by appearances.<br />
<strong>Perhaps yesterday you decided wrongly about me, and perhaps
today you misjudged me as well. However, I remain myself. I never cared
about others misjudging me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Chen Gong leaving Cao Cao:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>He killed a dozen innocent people, yet he can sleep so soundly. What
manner of man is he? is he even human? Cao Cao's words our crueler then
the sharpest blade. The blade only killed the Lu family, but with those
words he can persecute the whole world. This man is even more
treacherous than Dong Zhuo, more dangerous, more worthy of fear. He will
surely bring harm two people if he lives. Why don't I kill him now and
rid the world of a scourge?</p>
<p>(Chen Gong is about to stab Cao Cao with a sword, but hesitates.)</p>
<p>I just saved him yesterday, and today I'm killing him. Am I right to
do this? Wouldn't that make me a fickle person? Though Cao Cao is
dishonorable, I can not be faithless.</p>
<p>(Chen Gong sticks the sword onto a piece of wood near Cao Cao, and
leaves without Cao Cao waking up.)<br />
(Cao Cao wakes up in the morning, sees the sword and realizes what
happened and laughs.)<br />
<strong>If you wanted to kill me, you should have just done it. why
hesitate and make yourself miserable?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cao Cao: Fengxian, what a pleasure to see you. Lu Bu: Mengde, It's
been many years. Cao Cao: It has. We haven't met since that time back at
Dong Zhuo's residence. How absence makes the heart grow fond.</p>
<p>Lu Bu: I will tell you frankly that i have still over 50,000 troops.
I have grain to last me 100 days. And the wall of Xiapi are, as you see,
30 spans in height and 20 spans thick. The Si river defends the city on
three sides. It's not an easy city to attack.</p>
<p>Cao Cao: Fengxian, I'm not here today to listen to that. I'm here to
catch up with an old friend. Lu Bu: Catch up?</p>
<p>Cao Cao: Yes. Let me be honest with you. Among the lords of the
realm, I fear no one, no one but you, Lu Fengxian. Among the lords of
the realm, I respect no one, no one but you, Lu Fengxian. To summarIze,
i respect you and fear you at the same time.</p>
<p>Lu Bu: Really?</p>
<p>Cao Cao: Of course. Think about it. Ever since Dong Zhuo entered the
capital, Yuan Shu, Yuan Shao, Liu Biao, Tao Qian, Gongsun Zan, and I,
Cao Cao have each seized land and built his own power. However none of
us can reunite the realm. Why? It's precisely because of you Lu
Fengxian!</p>
<p>Lu Bu: Hmm?</p>
<p>Cao Cao: When you were on Dong Zhuo's side, Dong Zhuo wielded sole
power over the capital. When you helped Yuan Shu, he became bold enough
to call himself emperor! When you helped Liu Bei, without expending a
single soldier, you secured peace with just one arrow by your
halberd-shooting feat.</p>
<p>(Lu Bu looks pleased with himself.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao: "Lǔ Bù among men, Red hare among horses".<br />
(Rén zhōng Lu Bu, mǎ zhōng Chì tù «人中呂布，马中赤兔»)<br />
It is said in truth. Together with that trident halberd in your hands,
you are truly peerless in the world.</p>
<p>Lu Bu (pleased): Of course, of course.</p>
<p>Cao Cao: Given all that, as long you're willing to assist me, my
ambitions will certainly be fulfilled.</p>
<p>(Chen Gong shown looking over Cao Cao and Lu Bu from the
fortifications.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao: <strong>However, over the years you have been busy fighting
here and there, without a plan coming and going as you please</strong>,
specializing in annoying all the local lords. If someone takes you in,
you end up taking their city. But if they want to eliminate you, they
aren't your match in battle, and up being killed by you instead. Isn't
that so?</p>
<p>Lu Bu: Yes, brother Mengde, you've said correctly.</p>
<p>Cao Cao: So, after pondering much about it, I now think that, rather
than us fighting each other to our deaths..</p>
<p>(Lu Bu smiling, looking real pleased.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao: .. I might as well take a risk. What kind of risk, you ask?
I will propose and alliance with you. We will achieve our ambitions
together.</p>
<p>(Chen Gong senses danger.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao: As long as we stand together, we can conquer the world.
Fengxian, listen carefully. I want to give you all my troops and horses.
you will be my field marshal, and do nothing but fight. and me, I will
supply you with grain and arms. Fighting is not my speciality. but
supporting those are good at fighting - that is exactly what I'm good
at!</p>
<p>Lu Bu: If Dong Zhuo was willing to do that, he would have been
emperor long ago! Cao Cao: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Dong Zhuo was
foolish. he did not see your true value. Fengxian, let's have a truce,
hmm? right here, beneath the city walls, beside the Si river. We will
swear that blood oath and slaughter a horse in sacrifice. We will become
sworn brothers. Don't you think that it's a great idea?</p>
<p>Chen Gong: (shouting from the fortifications) Cao Ahman! Do you still
recognize me?</p>
<p>Cao Cao: (looking up) Oh, it's brother Gongtai! It's been many years.
I have missed you so much! There's still a jug of wine that we need to
finish together! Chen Gong: Forget about the wine. but come take this
arrow!</p>
<p>(Chen Gong shoots an arrow in Cao Cao's direction, causing Cao Cao to
flee.)</p>
<p>Chen Gong: Fengxian, hurry and return to the city! Hurry!</p>
<p>(Lu Bu re-enters the city.)</p>
<p>(Cut to Cao Cao returning to his camp, looking angry.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao: Damn it! Damn it! If it weren't for Chen Gong's arrow, I
would have talked that dolt over. I swear I will kill Chen Gong.</p>

Cao Cao: I have said many words. which ones are you referring to
specifically?<br />
Lu Bu: You said that i am the one you fear the most, and I'm also the
one that you respect the most. You said for me to be a field marshal, to
conquer the world for you and to achieve our ambitions together. Lord
Cao, I'm willing to be your field marshal.<br />
Cao Cao: <strong>I have indeed said those words. but when I was saying
them, you were in a castle and I was outside it.</strong> I have no
choice but to cooperate with you. But now? Look at yourself.<br />
Just a prisoner beneath my steps. How are you going to achieve ambitions
together with me?<br />

Cao Cao: Brother Gongtai, your kindness in saving me at Zhongmou county
will be engraved in my heart forever.<br />

Chen Gong: How I regret. That night at Chenggao county, I really should
have stabbed that heart out.<br />
Cao Cao: Understandable. Completely understandable. Even I feel sorry
for you.<br />
(Cao Cao laughs.)<br />
Chen Gong: Truly a depraved fiend and a shameless fellow.<br />
Cao Cao: Brother Gongtai, there is one thing that I can't understand. If
you were looking for glory, why didn't you come to me, but to Lu Bu
instead? He is undeserving of your talents and aspirations.<br />
Chen Gong: I only regret that Lu Bu didn't listen to me. If he did,
things wouldn't be as they are today. Even though Lu Bu is ignorant, he
is much more pure-hearted than you can ever be.<br />
Cao Cao: Pure-hearted indeed. So pure that he's like an imbecile.<br />
Cao Cao: Brother Gongtai, I would like your opinion on one more
thing.<br />
Chen Gong: Speak.<br />
Cao Cao: Tell me, should I kill you? Or should I keep you?<br />
Chen Gong: That's easy enough. Hurry up and kill me.<br />
Cao Cao: I can't bring myself to. I really can't bring myself to.<br />
Chen Gong: Than I shall give you a reason to. So that you can bring
yourself to killing me.<br />
Cao Cao: Let's hear it.<br />
Chen Gong: As long as I, Chen Gong, am alive, I will not stop telling
others about your despicable acts from back then. I will talk about them
every day. I've let everyone in the world know, and let your name be
held in infamy forever.<br />
(Cao Cao laughs. Chen Gongs stands up addresses those around him.)<br />
Chen Gong: All of you listen up!<br />
Chen Gong: Back then when Cao Mengde was a fugitive in Chenggao county,
he was saved by his uncle Lu Boshe. However, he repaid kindness with
wickedness, and murdered Lu Boshe. I have witnessed that with my own
eyes. he repays kindness with wickedness. He kills his own uncle. Here
you have a depraved fiend and a shameless fellow.<br />
Cao Ren: Men! Drag him out! Hurry and drag him out.<br />
Cao Cao: Insolence!<br />
Cao Cao: Who do you think my brother Gongtai is? He's my savior.<br />
Cao Cao: <strong>So what if he has a few harsh words for me? It's not
like that they can hurt me anyway.</strong> Furthermore, Gongtai's words
were reasonable.<br />
Cao Cao: <strong>You rebuked me well. Go on. Keep rebuking me. And once
you have worked yourself up enough, we will have some
wine.</strong><br />
Chen Gong: Oh, Cao Mengde.. I never imagined that you could be so thick
skinned.<br />
(Cao Cao rises.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao:<br />
<strong>It's not that my skin is thick. It's just that I have long since
thrown out of my mind all those mundane concepts of ethics and
scruples.<br />
They call me a crafty villain, but they cannot do anything about this
crafty villain either. Whereas you people who hold yourselves to be true
gentleman have all been defeated by me.<br />
If the price of being gentlemanly is to be oppressed, trampled upon,
destroyed, or even killed, I would rather be a crafty villain who can
realize his own dreams and aspirations.<br />
The greatest traitor has always resembled an honest man, and the
greatest falsehood come across as truth.<br />
Righteousness and evil cannot be discerned by their appearances. Perhaps
in the past you decided wrongly about me, and perhaps today you
misjudged me too. However, I remain myself. I have never cared about
others misjudging me.</strong></p>
<p>Cao Cao: Brother Gongtai, examine your heart and tell me, have I
spoken truly?<br />
Chen Gong: Enough of that. hurry and bring out the wine.<br />
Cao Cao: Bring the wine.<br />
Chen Gong: Go ahead.<br />
(Chen Gong and Cao Cao drinks the wine.)<br />
Chen Gong: Where are the executioners? Hurry and send me on my
way.<br />
Cao Cao: Brother Gongtai, will you allow me to see you off one last
time?<br />
Chen Gong: Let's go.</p>

<li>Cao Cao trying to disuade Chen Gong from courting death:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Cao Cao: I know that you have an elderly mother at home. If you die,
what will she do? Can you bear to leave her like that?<br />
Chen Gong: I have heard that he who governs with filial piety metes out
punishment accordingly, and does not injure another's parents. I don't
think you would kill my elderly mother, but would rather see to her
needs for the rest of her life.<br />
Cao Cao: That's right.<br />
Cao Cao: Gongtai, I also know that you have two children. The girl is
seven, the boy is five. They're still young. If you go, what will they
do? Can you bear to leave them like that?<br />
Chen Gong: My son and daughter will eke out a living themselves. Heaven
will provide for them. I won't trouble you with them.<br />
(Cao Cao turns to Chen Gong and takes his hands in his.)<br />
Cao Cao: Brother Gongtai, I've never before begged anyone for anything.
But, today.. I really can't bear to let you go.<br />
Chen Gong: I know. However it's me myself who have decided to go.<br />
Chen Gong: I beseech you, Mengde, grant me my wish.<br />
(Chen Gong takes off Cao Cao hand from his and turns to look at the land
in front of him.)<br />
Chen Gong: My land, my beautiful land.<br />
(Cao Cao, sad, turns away as the executioner advances.)<br />
Chen Gong: My land, my beautiful land.<br />

<ul>
<li>Cao Cao before Guandu:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was around twenty years old, I idolized our dear Yuan Shao
quite a bit.<br />
Why?<br />
Because he comes from a noble lineage, and his former protégées are all
over the land.<br />
Whereas my grandfather was a eunuch. I felt ashamed in comparison, and
worried about Yuan Shao scorning me.</p>
<p>When I was about thirty, we were colleagues in the same court. While
I continued to appear to respect him, in my heart I already held him in
disdain.<br />
Why?<br />
Because it was he who asked Dong Zhuo to bring his army to the capital,
which led to widespread catastrophe. And I had even warned him that this
was like inviting a wolf to one's house. He would only bring disaster
upon himself.</p>
<p>When I was about forty years old, we had each become a powerful lord
of our own states. This was when I started to hold him in utter
contempt.<br />
Why?<br />
Because, though a lord over men, he is narrow-minded and ignorant. He
appears liberal but is grudging at heart. He's willfull and suspicious.
Though a commander-in-chief, he is indecisive on strategy. Outwardly
bold but a coward at heart. He has soldiers aplenty but cannot direct
them uniformly. He has proud warriors, but cannot give them clear
commands. Though a father, he indulged his sons in building up their own
military power and tussling to be his heir. He employs those with
connections, but not those with ability.<br />
From this, we can see that this dear Yuan Shao of ours, whether as lord,
father, or commander, is only respectable on the surface but quite
mediocre within.</p>
<p>This battle, I have foreseen as long as eight years ago. We had
defeated Yuan Shu, annihilated Lü Bu, received the emperor, recovered Xu
Province, and established ourselves in the Central plains. It was only a
matter of time before we have one final, decisive battle against Yuan
Shao. Therefore, over the last eight years, I have been preparing for
this battle day and night.</p>
<p>Today I shall tell you this:</p>
<p>Eight years ago, Yuan Shao held an army of 300,000.<br />
I thought, I'd need an army of 200,000 if I wanted to defeat him at
all.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Yuan Shao's army increased to 500,000.<br />
I thought, I'd need an army of 100,000 if I wanted to defeat him at
all.</p>
<p>And now, Yuan Shao's force has grown to 700,000.<br />
Of all the provinces in the realm, he alone controls four. If that's not
power, what is?<br />
But now I'm thinking, to defeat Yuan Shao, I will only require 70,000
elite troops!</p>
<p>Xun Yu: Why is it that, the more troops Yuan Shao fields, the fewer
you will need?</p>
<p>Cao Cao: <strong>It's not size that counts in an army, but
skill.<br />
It's not prowess that counts in a captain, but finesse.</strong></p>
<p>If we are solely comparing the size of our armies, I will never catch
up to Yuan Shao. But if we're comparing capability and resourcefulness,
even if you tie three Yuan Benchus together they will still be inferior
to one Cao Cao!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cao Cao stalling Yuan Shao at Guandu:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your magnaninimity, brother.</p>
<p>(Cao Cao shifts from his docile sitting position to an arrogant one,
and laughs at Yuan Shao. Yuan Shao is suddenly worried.)</p>
<p>Yuan Shao, if I were you, I would never agree to a truce with Cao
Mengde. I'd only build a great tomb of marble for him.<br />
That's because for as long as there is breath in him, Cao Mengde will
never be defeated in battle!</p>
<p>(Cao Cao wobbles his head mockingly, laughs at him and then runs
away.)</p>

<p>Let's fill our cups and drink to song -<br />
For life's such joys do not last long,<br />
but are ephemeral, as morning dew,<br />
which soon will to the past belong.</p>
<p>"Make merry!" - they say, but how could I<br />
dispel the sorrows of my heart?<br />
How indeed, to ease my mind,<br />
but by the cup of Du Kang's art?</p>
<p>The scholar's robe is a deep, deep blue,<br />
but my yearning's deeper yet<br />
for you, my dear friends; and passions true<br />
today my heart beset.</p>
<p>Gently bleats the little deer,<br />
and turns to graze agains.<br />
Worthy guests are gathered here<br />
as the lutes begin their strain.</p>
<p>Brightly shines the moon up high,<br />
but forever beyond my hold.<br />
While from within my sadness grows<br />
and cannot be controlled.</p>
<p>From far and wide you've come, my friends,<br />
to honour me tonight;<br />
and at this feast we reminisce<br />
old times to our hearts' delight.</p>
<p>The moon shines bright, the stars glow dim,<br />
as the magpie southward flies.<br />
Around a tree he circles thrice,<br />
but no resting place he spies.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as a peak too high;<br />
there is no too deep a sea.<br />
The Duke of Zhou forgot himself<br />
and the empire's love gained he.</p>

<li>Cao Cao's speech after defeat at Red Cliffs (Chibi):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A military commander is like a physician.<br />
<strong>When a physician treats more and more patients, his medical
skills become better and better.</strong><br />
In other words, when more people die from failed treatments, the
physicians skills become better.</p>
<p>If a military commander does not taste defeat every now and then, how
will he know how to fight a victorious battle?</p>
<p>In this world, there is no such thing as an ever victorious
commander.<br />
There are only commanders who do not give up after a defeat, who grow
stronger from experience, and who eventually emerge victorious.</p>
<p>Our army of 8,30,000 men embarked on a conquest in the south, but was
defeated by Sun Quan and Liu Bei with just about 60,000 men.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I think the most fundamental reason was that in recent years we have
won too many battles.<br />
The army became arrogant, the generals lazy, the civil officials
indolent and the military officials frivolous.<br />
We, especially I, became conceited and underestimated the enemy.<br />
I could not see through even a simply battered body ruse. This resulted
in the success of Wu's fire attack.</p>
<p>So you see, I think it was time for us to taste the bitterness of
defeat.<br />
Failure is a good thing. <strong>Failure teaches us how to
succeed.</strong> Failure teaches us how we can achieve victory. Failure
teaches us how we can conquer the world.</p>
<p><strong>If a person wants to succeed, he must know when to hold on
and when to let go.</strong><br />
It is the same with warfare.<br />
One must be able to win and also be able to lose (gracefully).</p>
<p>Although we tasted bitter defeat at Red Cliff, our foundations reamin
unshaken. Of the whole empire, we still have in our hands the four
provinces of Qing, You, Bing and Ji.<br />
Our cities, armies, population and tax revenue are still many times
those of Sun Quan and Liu Bei's.<br />
The imperial court is still in Xuchang, and still in our hands.</p>
<p>But what about Sun Quan and Liu Bei? <strong>In times of danger, they
will embrace each other and fight the common enemy. But once they are
victorious, they will contend with each other covertly or overtly and
scheme against each other.</strong><br />
For example, if Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang were working with one heart and
one mind, how would it be possible for us to escape from the roads at
Wulin? Don't you agree.</p>
<p>(Murmurs of agreement among the soldiers.)</p>
<p>If Sun Quan and Liu Bei are like this already, it'll only get worse
with time. In conclusion, they will eventually split up and will
eventually fall.</p>

Zhongda.</p>
<p>Sima Yi: The wrongdoes Sima Yi pays his respects to His
Excellency.</p>
<p>Cao Cao:<br />
Five years ago, I had many people recommending you. they said you are
extremely talented. Then I sent my men to invite you to take up office.
But you lay in bed pretending to be paralyzed and refused to accept my
summons.<br />
Two years later, I sent my men to recruit you again. I even ordered for
you to be arrested if you refused to come. However, you still managed to
escape. in the end, they only managed to bring back your writings. I
sent men to arrest you many times. They searched every single province,
county and city in the Central Planes.<br />
Who knew, you were hiding here all along. Heh!</p>
<p>Sima Yi: I also did not expect your excellency to recognize my
handwriting.</p>
<p>(Cao Cao laughs.)</p>
<p>Cao Cao:<br />
I was just bluffing you. In truth, I cannot even remember your
handwriting. But your appearance bears some resemblance to your elder
brother, Sima Lang, and from your words in the cell, I could tell that
you have great foresight. Hence, I guessed you were Sima Yi, and shouted
your name. Indeed it was so.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Lu Su: What I meant was, if we go and demand the province, what
should we do if we can get it back? And what should be do if we
can't?</p>
<p>Sun Quan: You're right. When I think about it rationally, it seems
more likely that be can't regain it. Jing is a piece of meat that they
have already put in their mouth and swallowed down. Why would they spit
it out so willingly?</p>
<p>Lu Su: My lord, please forgive me for being blunt. judging by the
current situation, Liu Bei has just gained for commanderies in rapid
succession. his army gained much in strength and momentum. With losses
on our side and gains on theirs, our strength is about even now. I think
Zhuge Liang is counting on us not declaring war on them, and so he will
certainly put off returning Jing to us</p>
<p>Sun Quan: Kongming is guileful, and Liu Bei is a hypocrite.</p>
<p>Lu Su: My lord, in this world of chaos, there are no such things as
guile and hypocrisy, but only the difference between the strong and the
weak.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "<strong>He who is successful is a hero, he who
isn't is an outlaw</strong>".</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sun Quan deciding to call upon Liu Bei to fulfill his promise:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We must demand Jing to be returned to us.<br />
We'll demand it back even if they won't return it.<br />
To put it bluntly, even knowing full well we can't get it back, we'll
still demand it.<br />
Firstly, if we go and demand for it, it will prove that we have insisted
all along that Jing belongs to us, while Liu Bei is only a guest in the
province.<br />
Secondly, if they don't go demand for it, they will hold us in even more
disregard, and come to see Jing as rightfully theirs.<br />
Thirdly, if we ask for it and they don't give it, the fault will be
theirs.<br />
When the time is ripe, and we take military action to take Jing, we
would simply be reclaiming what's ours.<br />
We'd have every right and justification to do so.</p>

Zhou Yu: How much more does he want?<br />
Lu Meng: He asked for 20,000 more.<br />
Zhou Yu: And what did our lord say?<br />
Lu Meng: He seeks your opinion.<br />
Zhou Yu: Well then.. i think an increment of 20,000 is too little. round
it up and give him any even 100,000.<br />
Lu Meng: Grand commander, we are pressed for cash. Officers of all ranks
had to cut back for the military. This is a huge expense. We won't be
able to maintain it in the long run.<br />
Zhou Yu: To spend 100,000 every month on a son in law is indeed too
much. But if it can buy us back Jingzhou, it is too good to pass up.
Wait a little longer. <strong>When this lifestyle has utterly corrupted
him, he will be mine to control.</strong></p>

the show.<br />
Lu Meng: Please speak plainly, Grand commander.</p>
<p>Zhou Yu:<br />
Keep Liu Bei confined here. Put him in a luxurious mansion and make him
lose his will. Give him treasures and beautiful women to confound his
senses. In short, attend to him carefully.<br />
In time, he will only remember himself as a son in law of the southland,
and forget about Jing.<br />
When his men see that he is not returning, chaos will ensue. And then
we'll find an opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>Lu Meng: Grand commander, Liu Bei has always had high ambitions. I
fear mere trinkets and beauties cannot rob him of his will.</p>
<p>Zhou Yu: He's called the Imperial Uncle, but his beginnings were
humble. He has drifted from place to place, suffering much distribution
and misery. He has never been able to enjoy of worldly pleasures. If he
were to experience them now, he'd be like a man who after starving for
days, has a banquet set in front of him. Who can tell how big his
appetite could be?</p>
<p>Lu Meng: You're right, grand commander.</p>
<p>Zhou Yu: As the State Mother ordered, Lord Sun I allocated the
eastern residence to Liu Bei. Have it renovated, and plant flowers and
shrubs all around. All utensils and household items must be of the
highest quality. Also, given more dancers, and gather more precious
jewels and silks for him. Money is no object. Let Liu Bei enjoy a life
that would make even the gods envious.</p>

Wenrou, rest in peace.<br />
Do you know? I miss the old times we spent together. Without you, Xun
Wenrou, how would I have accomplished what I have today?</p>
<p>In the first year of Xingping (Xingping reign = 194 AD), when I was
fighting Tao Qian, you remained beind to defend Yanzhou. You devoted
your energies to ensure that I had no shortage of supplies.</p>
<p>When Zhang Miao rebelled, every county rose in support of him. Again,
it was you who led the army in defence, and ensured that my main camp
didn't fall.</p>
<p>In the fifth year of Jian'an (200 AD), during the battle of Guandu,
my army ran out of food and the soldiers' morale was in turmoil. All the
generals wanted me to withdraw, but you alone advised me to defend and
<strong>wait for the right opportunity</strong>. You delivered food and
equipment to me overnight. With that, I was able to sieze victory with a
surprise attack, and utterly defeated Yuan Shao.</p>
<p>Oh, Wenrou.. You were my Zhang Liang, Zhang Zifang. You were like my
own arms. You were my brother. It's a pity that you did not share my
ideals.</p>

Yes.. I understand.<br />
Father, you had to kill an old friend who you had no choice but to kill.
Moreover this friend was a confidant of yours.</p>

<p>After the demise of Emperor Ling, the imperial court became weakd and
corrupt. Emperors sold posts for money. Court officials extorted taxes
ruthlessly. Warlords sprung up all over the land and created unrest. The
entire Han court was like the rubble under my feet.</p>
<p>It was only because I gave my all to rebuild this empire that the
commoners finally had something to eat. I wiped out all venues for those
corrupt officials to commit evil.</p>
<p>I personally believe that I have somewhat contributed to the empire.
So why do people hate me so much? Or even want to kill me? Do you people
want to turn the Han empire into a pile of debris again?</p>

writing of the sages. In death, I remain true to their teachings.</p>
<p>Cao Cao:<br />
<strong>If the teachings of the sages worked, the sages themselves would
have ruled the world long ago!</strong><br />
Do you know? This is called blind devotion. Corrupt officials are
despicable, fatuous rulers are despicable, <strong>but even more
despicable are those are blind devotion, like you!</strong> Geng Ji: Cao
Ahman, even if I cannot kill you while I'm alive, my ghost shall haunt
you to death!<br />
Cao Cao: Really?</p>
<p>(Cao Cao grabs Geng Ji's face.)</p>

Cao Shuang: What decree? Give it to me, I shall present it to his
majesty.<br />
Someone: The empress dowager has instructed that the decree be announced
in public.<br />
(Emperor dismounts his carriage and kneels to receive the decree, after
which Cao Shuang and other do the same.)<br />
Someone: The late emperor has entrusted his son to Cao Shuang, the
Regent-General, and ordered him to assist the young emperor. Cao Shuang
should have served the throne loyally but he was corrupted by power,
establishing his own dictatorship and engaging in nepotism. His actions
have tormented the country and left the court in grade disorder. And
thus, the country knows only of the Regent-General's power, and not of
the Emperor's. His treachery has incurred the greatest indignation.
Today, the imperial tutor, Sima Yi, is called upon to take charge of
state affairs and place Cao Shuang and his followers under arrest,
reforming the court and reinstating the emperor's reign. All officials
should know what is right and join Sima Yi in establishing proper order
in the court. Those who conspire with Cao Shuang to defy the decree,
shall be punished without leniency.<br />
(Cao Shuang sees Sima Yi in his carriage.)<br />
Cao Shuang: Sima Yi!<br />
Cao Shuang: You.. How dare you feign illness to ensnare me!<br />
Messenger: Cao Shuang, Sima Yi's generals have taken command of the
imperial guards. Now he has all of Luoyang in his grasp. with your
limited military strength, you are destined to fail if you decide to
resist.<br />
Cao Shuang: His majesty's here. everyone, join me to protect the emperor
and kill this Sima traitor!<br />
Messenger: Everyone, your family members have been escorted by general
Sima Zhao to the camps of the imperial guards…<br />
(Sima Yi takes off his shoes and descends his carriage and starts
walking through the sand to Cao Shuang.)<br />
Messenger: … can you bear to see your families die?<br />
Someone: Your Majesty, Sima Yi has more men than you. Please consider
the situation. Do not resist under any circumstances.<br />
Someone: Your Majesty, Sima Yi his only after Cao Shuang. You will not
be harmed.<br />
Someone: Your Majesty, please order Regent-General Cao Shuang to
surrender.<br />
(Flashback to Sima Yi's conversation with Cao Cao.)<br />
Cao Cao: Let me ask you this: Why are the soles of a man's feet paler
than his face and his hands?<br />
Sima Yi: I don't know.<br />
Cao Cao: Because he always has them hidden.<br />
(Flashback ends. Sima Yi continues to walk towards Cao Shuang.)<br />
Cao Shuang: our ancestors have ruled for three generations, yet we have
fallen to such a tragic end.<br />
(Cao Shuang drops his sword. Instantly soldiers grab him and force him
to the ground.)<br />
(Sima Yi places his foot on Cao Shuang's back.)<br />
Cao Shuang: Sima Yi.. Sima Yi, you have won. in just one day, you were
able to seize the lands built over the four regimes of the Cao
family.<br />
Sima Yi: I may wield my sword only once in my life, but I have spent
over ten years honing its blade. Your forefather Cao Cao deserves credit
for teaching me that.</p>
