<li>s1e01: Sir Humphry's arrival:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Bernard: A sherry Minister?<br />
Jim: Jim.<br />
Bernard: Oh, Gin.<br />
Jim: No, no, Jim, Jim. Call me Jim.<br />
Bernard: I would preferto call you Minister, Minister.<br />
Jim: Minister-minister?<br />
Jim: Oh quite, quite… I see what you mean.<br />
Jim: Do I have to call you Private Secretary, Private Secretary?<br />
Bernard: No. Do call me Bernard.<br />
Jim: Thank you, Bernard.<br />
Bernard: You're most welcome.<br />
Bernard: Your health, Minister.<br />
Jim: Well what now?<br />
(Humphrey enters)<br />
Bernard: Allow me to present Sir Humphrey Appleby, Permanent
UnderSecretary of State and Head of the DAA.<br />
Jim: Hello, Sir Humphrey.<br />
Humphrey: Hello, and welcome.<br />
Jim: Thank you.<br />
Bernard: I believe you know each other.<br />
Humphrey: Yes, we did cross swords in the Public Accounts
Committee.<br />
Jim: I wouldn't say that.<br />
Humphrey: You came up with all the questions.<br />
Jim: Opposition's about asking questions.<br />
Humphrey: And Government's about not answering them.<br />
Jim: You answered mine.<br />
Humphrey: I'm glad you thought so, Minister.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When Jim tries out his chair:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Jim: I'd like a new chair. Hate swivel chairs.</p>
<p>Bernard:<br />
Two kinds of chairs to go with the two kinds of Minister:<br />
- One sort folds up instantly,<br />
- the other sort goes round and round in circles.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Humphrey mentioning something Hacker had said while still in the
opposition:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the Minister aware that planning procedures make building a
bungalow in the 20th century slower than building a cathedral in the
12th century?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Humphrey to Bernard while with Sir Arnold:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Bernard: What do you propose to do?<br />
Humphrey: Can you keep a secret?<br />
Bernard: Of course.<br />
(Humphrey slowly leans towards Bernard.)<br />
Humphrey: So can I.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>s1e02: Minister about his correspondence:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Minister: When am I going to do all this correspondence?<br />
Bernard: You do realise you don't actually have to.<br />
Minister: Don't I?<br />
Bernard: We can draft an official reply.<br />
Minister: What's that?</p>
<p>Bernard:<br />
"The Minister thanks you forthe letter".<br />
Then we say: "The matter is under consideration".<br />
Or even, "underactive consideration".</p>
<p>Minister: What's the difference?</p>
<p>Bernard:<br />
"Under consideration" means we've lost the file.<br />
"Underactive consideration" means we're trying to find it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jim: When did a civil servant last refuse an honour?!<br />
Somebody in the Treasury refused a knighthood.<br />
Jim: When?<br />
I think it was 1496.<br />
Jim: Why?<br />
He'd already got one.</p>

<li>s2e2:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Humphrey: The system has worked so well in the past.<br />
Jim: It hasn't.<br />
Humphrey: Give it a fair trial.<br />
Jim:<br />
I thought you might say that…<br />
The Most Noble Order of the Garter was founded in 1348 by Edward
III.<br />
It's at the end of its trial period now.</p>
<p>Humphrey: Minister, if you block honours pending economies, you might
create a dangerous precedent.<br />
Jim: If we do the right thing now, we'll have to do the right thing next
time?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>s2e2: Bernard when Humphrey was talking to Jim about funding issue a
college:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Baillie College has an outstanding record.<br />
It's filled our jails for years.<br />
Jim: Jails?<br />
Yes. The letters "JB" are the finest honour in the Commonwealth.<br />
Jim: "JB"?<br />
Humphrey: "Jailed by the British".<br />
Humphrey: Gandhi, Nkrumah, Makarios, Ben-Gurion, Kenyatta, Nehru,
Mugabe.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>s2e2:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Jim: What has Sir Arnold to fear? He has all the honours he could
want.<br />
Bernard: He has his "G".<br />
Jim: "G"?<br />
Bernard: You get your "G" after your "K".<br />
Jim: You speak in riddles.<br />
Bernard: First you get the CMG, then the KCMG and the GCMG, the Command
of the Order of St Michael and St George, Knight Grand Cross of St
George.<br />
Bernard: In the service, CMG stands for "Call Me God".<br />
Bernard: And KCMG for "Kindly Call Me God".<br />
Jim: And GCMG?<br />
Bernard: "God Calls Me God".</p>
<p>Jim: Why should Sir Arnold worry? He has his full quota of
honours.<br />
Bernard: Nowhere near!<br />
Bernard: There's a peerage, the CH, the OM, the Knight of the
Thistle…<br />
Jim: Knight of the Thistle? Who for? Scotsmen and donkeys?!<br />
Bernard: There's a distinction.<br />
Jim: You haven't met the Scottish Nationalists!<br />
Jim: How do they award the Thistle?<br />
Bernard: A committee sits on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>s2e2:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Jim: How much further?<br />
Bernard: A few minutes. The M40's good.<br />
Jim: So's the M4… Why did we get two really good roads to Oxford before
any to Southampton or Dover or any of the ports?<br />
Nearly all our Permanent Secretaries went to Oxford, Minister, and most
Oxford colleges give very good dinners.<br />
Jim: The Cabinet allow that?<br />
Bernard: Certainly not.<br />
Bernard: They said no motorway to take civil servants to Oxford, unless
there was one to take Ministers hunting in the shires.<br />
Bernard: That's why the M1 stopped in Leicestershire!<br />
Jim: Oh, come! What about the M11 just completed? Doesn't Cambridge give
as good dinners?<br />
Bernard: Yes, of course, but it's been years since Transport had a
Permanent Secretary from Cambridge.</p>

Jesus… Christ.</p>

<ul>
<li>s2e2: Humphrey coercing Jim with a honourary doctorate:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, minutes of the previous meeting?<br />
Matters arising: Accommodation.<br />
Oh, yes!<br />
I'm happy to be able to tell you that we have found a 5% cut, by selling
an office in High Wycombe.<br />
- Oh, really?<br />
- Yes.<br />
- Yes, very good.<br />
- Yes.<br />
Stationery acquisition?<br />
We've discovered a new stock control system to reduce expenditure.<br />
- By how much?<br />
- About 5%, wasn't it?<br />
Excellent! Parks and Forestry?<br />
If we delay the new computers, we can make a saving.<br />
- By how much?<br />
- Yes…?<br />
- About 5%.<br />
- Yes, about 5%.<br />
- Really?<br />
- That cuts data processing, too.<br />
- By…?<br />
- By…<br />
By about 5%.<br />
- This is most satisfying.<br />
- Yes.<br />
Incidentally, while I think of it, have you finished with the list for
the honours secretary?<br />
Yes, Humphrey. No problem there. Bernard will give it to you.<br />
- Thank you, Bernard.<br />
- All right, Humphrey?<br />
Yes, Doctor… er, Minister.</p>

<li>s2e7: Jim throwing Humphrey under the bus in front of a
committee:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Jim: but I must say in public, that reforms can and will take place,
and I know I shall find in Sir Humphrey my staunchest ally. Isn't that
so, Humphrey?<br />
Humphrey: Yes, Minister.<br />
Yes, Minister.<br />
(Back in the minister's room)<br />
Humphrey: A big help!<br />
Jim: I did my best.<br />
Humphrey: The best for yourself! This is your idea of teamwork?
Amusing!<br />
Jim: I had to do it.<br />
Humphrey: Had to do what?<br />
Cravenly admit everything to them?<br />
Don't you realise how calamitous this is for us?<br />
Jim: Not both of us, I hope.<br />
Humphrey: You hope in vain. We're up in arms, with very little
confidence in you. As for Number 10, I shudder to think how the PM will
react to your public admission of failure.<br />
Bernard: A personal letter from the Prime Minister.<br />
Humphrey: I did warn you, Minister.<br />
Humphrey: Bernard, you should give some thought to drafting a
face-saving letter of resignation for the Minister.<br />
Jim: "Dear Jim…"<br />
Jim: "Dear Jim"?<br />
Jim: "We haven't seen enough of each other lately. Are you free for
lunch at Chequers on Sunday? We shall just be the family. I look forward
to seeing you."<br />
Humphrey: I don't think I…?<br />
Jim: It has paid off!</p>
<p>(Humphrey suddenly realizing what happened)</p>
<p>Humphrey: A conspiracy! That drink with Mark Spencer!<br />
Jim: "…not seen enough… Lunch at Chequers…"<br />
Jim: It's hand-written! Do you realise how much it's worth?<br />
Humphrey: I believe the going rate is thirty pieces of silver!</p>

Well, there is.<br />

<p>Yes, Minister?<br />
Call me Jim when we're alone.<br />
I'll try to remember that, Minister.<br />
Sarah tells me this complaint is nonsense.<br />
Oh, fine. So we can CGSM it.<br />
CGSM?<br />
Civil service code. It stands for Consignment of Geriatric Shoe
Manufacturers.<br />
(Jim looks surprised.)<br />
Load of old cobblers, Minister.<br />
I'm not a civil servant.<br />
I shall use my own code.<br />
I shall write 'round objects'.</p>
<p>… …</p>

<p>Guy: Excuse me, but I could not help overhearing your conversation

Bernard: That would be… Do you have any idea how much?<br />
Guy: Of course. An original 17th-century rosewater jar is very
valuable.<br />
Bernard: Oh, dear..<br />
Guy: You are not pleased?<br />
Bernard: Yes and no. If it's valuable, the minister won't be allowed to
keep it. I was rather hoping it wasn't.<br />
Guy: Ah…<br />
Guy: Well, as I was saying, an original 17th-century rosewater jar is
very valuable, but this copy, though excellently done, is not of the
same order.<br />

Isn't that right, Your Royal Highness?<br />
Yes, we regard it as a warm and gracious compliment.<br />

Humphrey: Minister, when in Rome…<br />

the Fiji Islands, you'd wear a grass skirt!<br />
Humphrey: The Foreign Office view, as Arabs are sensitive, is we should
show them whose side we're on.<br />
Jim: It may come as a surprise to the Foreign Office, but you're
supposed to be on <em>our</em> side!</p>

<ul>
<li>s3e3: Jim and officials using code to get liquor:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Minister, there's an urgent call for you in the communications room.
A Mr Haig.<br />
Jim: General Haig?<br />
No, Mr Haig. You know, with the dimples.<br />
Jim: Yes, yes. Do excuse me. Most important.</p>
<p>(in the communications room)<br />
Jim: I believe there's a message from Mr Haig.<br />
Yes, Minister.<br />
(Pulls out a bottle and pours the minister a drink).</p>
<p>… …</p>
<p>(After Mrs. Hacker talks to Bernard about a gift that she wants to
keep for herself.)</p>
<p>Bernard. Wanted in the communications room. A Mr John Walker.<br />
Bernard: Johnnie Walker?<br />
Jim: Yes, from the Scotch Office… Sorry. Scottish Office.<br />
Mrs Hacker: Isn't there a message for me?<br />
Jim: Yes, of course. Bernard will get it for you if you give him your
glass.<br />
Jim: If you… give him your glass, he'll get you some more orange
juice.</p>
<p>… …</p>
<p>(After Hacker finds Humphrey dressed like an Arab.)</p>
<p>Bernard, any messages?<br />
Bernard: Well, there is one for Sir Humphrey.<br />
Oh, good.<br />
Bernard: The Soviet Embassy on the line. Mr Smirnoff.<br />
Sorry. So sorry.<br />
Isn't there one for me?<br />
There was a message from the Embassy. The school. A delegation of
Teachers.<br />
Ah, I must go and greet the Teachers… before the Bells goes… bell
goes!<br />
You're receiving a great many very urgent messages.<br />
Yes, yes, we are, aren't we?<br />
Excuse me.<br />
Your Royal Highness, could I present Mr Pennington?<br />
Excuse me.<br />
Yes, of course, Your Highness.</p>

The VAT man, your 69 returns.<br />
What?!<br />
VAT 69.<br />
Oh. Ah!<br />
Yes… thanks.<br />

almost as many urgent messages as he can take.</p>

Mrs. Hacker: She asked where it came from.<br />
Bernard: A journalist?<br />
Mrs. Hacker: Yes. Well, The Guardian, anyway.<br />
Mrs. Hacker: She asked what it was worth. I said £50.<br />

Bernard: She thought it was genuine?<br />
Mrs. Hacker: Bernard, you sound like an answering machine.<br />

Mrs. Hacker: She wanted to ring Kumran's Embassy to ask what it was
worth.<br />
Bernard: To ask what it was worth.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Jim when he saw the news about bribery in the newspaper:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not like the FT to print a story like this unless there's
something behind it.<br />
Is there something behind it, Humphrey?<br />
I think the sports news is behind it.<br />
I want to know the truth, Humphrey.<br />
I don't think you do.<br />
Will you answer a direct question?<br />
I strongly advise you not to ask one.<br />
Why?<br />
It might provoke a direct answer.<br />
It never has yet.<br />
What do YOU know about this? Tell me!<br />
Oh, well, I… er… Er, that is… there was.<br />
Someone did.<br />
A lot of gossip, that's all. Rumour, hearsay.<br />
Bernard?<br />
One Kumrani did tell me he'd received…<br />
Hearsay, Minister.<br />
Hearsay?<br />
Yes, Bernard heard him say it.<br />
Are you telling me that the contract<br />
was won by bribery?<br />
I do wish you wouldn't use words like bribery.<br />
What would you like me to say?<br />
Slush funds, sweeteners, brown envelopes?<br />
These are extremely crude<br />
and unworthy expressions<br />
for what is no more than creative negotiation.<br />
It is general practice.<br />
You do realise what you're saying?<br />
I ratified that contract in good faith!<br />
In that press communiqué, I announced a British success won in a fair
fight!<br />
Mm, yes, I did wonder about that bit.<br />
Now you're telling me it was got by bribery.<br />
No.<br />
Oh, it was not got by bribery?<br />
That is not what I said.<br />
What did you say?<br />
That I'm not telling you it was got by bribery.<br />
How would you describe these payments? How does the contract describe
them?<br />
Oh, well, that's quite simple.<br />
Retainers, personal donations, special discounts. Miscellaneous
outgoings, agents' fees, political contributions, management
expenses.<br />
How are these payments made?<br />
Anything from a numbered Swiss account to a fistful of used oncers
slipped under the door of the gents'.<br />
Do you realise how shocking this is?<br />
That is a narrow and parochial view. In other parts of the world, they
see things differently.<br />
Sin is not a branch of geography.<br />
But it is.<br />
In developing countries, the size of the extra contractual payment shows
how serious you are.<br />
It's like a publisher's advance to an author. Whoever pays the biggest
advance<br />
expects the biggest sales.<br />
I don't believe it! Is corruption government policy?<br />
No, no, Minister! It could never be government policy! That is
unthinkable… Only government practice.<br />
<br />
(Bernard gets a message.)<br />
That was the press office. The papers want a statement about the bribery
allegation.<br />
What am I going to say?<br />
The press office can devise something convincing and meaningless. That's
what they're paid for.<br />
You're a cynic, Humphrey.<br />
Cynic.<br />
A cynic is what an idealist calls a realist.<br />
I'll tell the truth. After all, I knew nothing of this. Why should I
back something I never approved?<br />
But this contract means thousands of British jobs, millions of export
dollars!<br />
Surely you won't throw all that away because of a technical
irregularity?<br />
It's not a technical irregularity, it is corruption!<br />
No. Merely a few uncontracted pre-payments.<br />
I don't expect you to understand, but government is not just a question
of fixing and manipulating.<br />
There is a moral dimension.<br />
Of, yes, of course, the moral dimension.<br />
It is never out of my thoughts.<br />
So if questions are asked in the press,<br />
I shall announce an inquiry.<br />
Splendid idea. I shall be happy to conduct it.<br />
No, no, no, no, no.<br />
No, not an internal inquiry, a REAL inquiry.<br />
You can't be serious!</p>
<p>…<br />
…</p>
<p>Jim:<br />
Minister, I agree with you. I see now that there is a moral dimension to
everything.<br />
Will you tell the press about the communications room or shall I?</p>
