<li>Opening line:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long
united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cao Cao after overcoming Ye, capital of Jizhou:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Cao Cao arrived at Ye, the city he had conquered. Xu You approached
him on horseback and, pointing to the gate with his whip, addressed the
prime minister by his childhood name, Ah Man. "Without me," Xu You
boasted loudly, "would you be entering in triumph today?" <strong>Cao
Cao laughed</strong>, but his commanders were outraged.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When Wang Xiu dared to mourn Yuan Tan's death:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Cao Cao remarked, "Many indeed were the loyal servants of the north.
<strong>And if the Yuans had made good use of them, I would never have
set my sights on this territory.</strong>" Cao Cao allowed Wang Xiu to
bury Yuan Tan's body, treated him as an honored guest, and made him an
officer in the Metals and Weaponry Division.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Upon Zhuge Ke's death:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Many years before, when Zhuge Jin was alive, he had observed that
Zhuge Ke was a man who let his brilliance show too completely, and he
had sighed as he reflected, "This is not a son who will preserve the
clan." Also, Zhang Qi, palace director under the Wei dynasty, had once
said to Sima Shi, "Zhuge Ke will not live long." When Sima Shi asked
why, Zhang Qi had replied, "<strong>His prestige constitutes a threat to
his lordâ€”how long can he survive?</strong>" In the event, these
predictions proved correct.</p>

<ul>
<li>About Jin about to conquer Wu:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Heaven may ordain, but men must achieve.</p>
