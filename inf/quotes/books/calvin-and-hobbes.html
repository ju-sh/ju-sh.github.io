<li>From a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<code>Calvin</code>: Everyone takes me for granted! Nobody pays any
attention to my needs!<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: Is it too much to ask for an occasional token
gesture of appreciation?<br />
<code>Mom</code>: Ok, how about a big hug?<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: Could I have 20 dollars?<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: See?! I don't matter to anyone! Nobody cares about
me!<br />

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
(Calvin talking to a television set)<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: Oh, great altar of passive entertainment…<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: Bestow upon me thy discordant images at such speed
as to render linear thought impossible!<br />
(TV gets switched on and Calvin gets engrossed in it.)<br />

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip where Dad tries to teach Calvin
math:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<code>Dad</code>: You've written here 8+4 = 7. Now you know that's not
right.<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: So I was off a little bit. Sue me.<br />
<code>Dad</code>: You can't add things and come out with less than you
started with!<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: I can do that! It's a free country! I've got my
rights!<br />

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
(Calvin is day-dreaming while in class.)<br />
<code>Miss Wormwood</code>: We're studying geography! Now what state do
you live in?<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: Denial.<br />
<code>Miss Wormwood</code>: .. Sighhhh.. I don't suppose I can argue
with that…<br />

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<code>Mom</code>: Calvin, I asked you to clean up your room.<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: I did!<br />
<code>Mom</code>: Well, you didn't do a very good job then. It looks as
messy as it did before.<br />
<code>Mom</code>: You should take pride in what you do, and always do
the best job possible.<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: I don't need to do a better job. <strong>I need
better P.R. on the job I do.</strong><br />

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<code>Calvin</code>: Dad, what's a control freak?<br />
<code>Dad</code>: That's what lazy, slipshod, careless, cut-corner
workers call anyone who cares enough to do something right.<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: Am I in the presence of their king? Should I
kneel?<br />
<code>Dad</code>: If anything works in this world, it's because one of
us took charge.<br />

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From 21 November 1993 strip:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
(Calvin looking at the moon.)<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: Sighhh…<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: I wish I could go to the moon.<br />
<code>Dad</code>: I wish you could too.<br />
<code>Mom</code>: Dear…<br />

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From 04 May 1994 strip. Calvin in conversation with Susie Derkins
about baseball:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<code>Calvin</code>: I hate all the rules and organization and teams and
ranks in sports.<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: Somebody's always yelling at you, telling you where
to be, what to do, and when to do it.<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: I figure when I want that, I'll join the army and
at least get paid.<br />

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From 18 May 1994 strip. When Calvin's house got broken into.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<code>Calvin</code>: Mom says Hobbes wouldn't have been stolen because
he's not valuable.<br />
<code>Calvin</code>: …(sniff) Well, I think he's valuable.<br />

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From 25 May 1994 strip. When Calvin's house got broken into.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Dad</code>: I don't think I'd have been in such a hurry to
reach adulthood if I'd known the whole thing was going to be
ad-libbed.</p>
