<blockquote>
<p>There once was on old man who really cherished his horse. It was his
best friend. He lived in the northern frontier in China was skilled in
interpreting events. One day for no reason, his horse ran away to the
nomads in the border. Everyone tried to console him. But his father
said, "What makes you so sure that it isn't a blessing?"</p>
<p>Some months later, his horse returned, bringing a splendid nomad
stallion. Everyone congratulated him, but his father said "What makes
you so sure that this isn't a disaster?" though their household was
richer by a fine horse, which the son loved to ride.</p>
<p>One day, he fell down and broke his hip. Everyone tried to console
him. But his father said, "What makes you so sure that this isn't a
blessing?".</p>
<p>A year later, the nomads came in force across the border. Every able
bodied man took his bow and went to battle. The Chinese frontiermen lost
nine of every ten men. Only because his son was lame, did the father and
son survive to take care of each other.</p>
<p>Truly, blessing turns into disaster and disaster into blessing: the
changes have no end, nor can the mystery be fathomed.</p>
