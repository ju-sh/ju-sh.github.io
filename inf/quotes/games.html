into darkness</em></a> campaign of <em>Battle for Wesnoth</em> after the
death of the protagonist who had originally turned into evil ways hoping
to do good (dialogue has since been changed):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Foolish Hero: Well, that is the end of his evil ways.<br />
Killing Unit: I wonder who he was in life, before falling into the evil
ways that led him to today.<br />
Foolish Hero: Once he chose this unlife for himself and his soldiers, he
forfeited any claim to our compassion. Does it even matter who he
was?<br />
Killing Unit: No, I suppose it does not.<br />
(Credits roll with Elvish theme.)</p>

<p>Mon Fils, Au jour de ta naissance,<br />
My son, the day you were born,</p>
<p>même les forêts de Lordaeron ont murmuré ton nom.. Arthas…<br />
the very forests of Lordaeron whispered then (your) name.. Arthas..</p>
<p>Mon enfant,<br />
My child,</p>
<p>C'est avec fierté que je t'ai vu grandir et devenir une arme au
service de la vertu.<br />
I watched with pride as you grew into a weapon of righteousness.</p>
<p>Souviens-toi, notre ligné a toujours régné avec force et
sagesse,<br />
Remember, our line has always ruled with wisdom and strength,</p>
<p>et je sais que tu feras preuve de retenue dans l'exercice de ton
grand pouvoir.<br />
And I know you will show restraint when exercising your great power.</p>
<p>Mais la plus belle des victoires, mon fils, et de faire battre le
coeur de ton peuple.<br />
But the truest victory, my son, is stirring the hearts of your
people.</p>
<p>Je te confie cela, car lorsque ma vie s'achèvera,<br />
I tell you this, for when my days have come to an end,</p>
<p>toi, tu seras roi.<br />
you shall be King.</p>

away'll force him to do things he shouldn't. - Read dead redemption</li>
