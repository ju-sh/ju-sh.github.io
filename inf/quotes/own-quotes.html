<li>വിത്ത് ഗുണം പത്തു ഗുണം എന്നതുകൊണ്ടുദ്ദേശിക്കുന്നത് വളർത്തു ഗുണം പത്തു ഗുണം എന്നാണ്.</li>
<li>If you cannot defend, don't offend. <!-- 25-Jul-2021 --></li>
<li>Speech that you disagree with is hate speech and everything else is
freedom of speech.. (Meant as a joke) <!-- 02-Aug-2021 --></li>
<li>Nuclear energy equipment can easily be converted to nuclear weapons.
It's as easy to weaponize religion as politics.
<!-- 04-Aug-2021 --></li>
<li>All centralized religious movements are doomed to become little more
than political parties, transforming into the very problem that it once
sought to remedy. <!-- 11-Sep-2021 --></li>
<li>Time is the fastest and most precious thing known to man.
<!-- 28-Oct-2021 --></li>
<li>God and religion are different things. Religion is just a typical
political party in a different outfit. <!-- 29-Oct-2021 --></li>
<li><strong>Don't compare yourselves with somebody else</strong>. It
leads to jealousy, hate and anger. None of which can lead to good in the
long run. You are what you are. You are unique. Stay unique. Don't
become someone else. Better yourselves while still being yourself.
<!-- 06-Nov-2021 --></li>
<li>If someone is famous it means that some people are making big money
by keeping him famous. In almost every case, it isn't the famous person
himself. <!-- 07-Nov-2021 --></li>
<li>Politics began when there were more than two humans who were in
contact with each other. <!-- 07-Nov-2021 --></li>
<li>Leaders are not manufactured. Their environment makes them
organically. Real leaders yearn to make people around them better more
than themselves. <!-- 09-Nov-2021 --></li>
<li>All successful politicians are good actors, but not all successful
actors would make successful politicians. <!-- 13-Nov-2021 --></li>
<li>Jealousy can eat you from within. <!-- 13-Nov-2021 --></li>
<li>The world is built and run on double standards.
<!-- 18-Nov-2021 --></li>
<li>Rules are meant only for those who can't break them and get away
with it. <!-- 20-Dec-2021 -->
<ul>
<li>There are two kinds of people who break rules big time: Those who
get away with and those that don't. That former will be hailed as heroes
because others can't touch them, the latter would be branded criminals.
<!-- 02-Oct-2022 --></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trust your instincts. It's right more often than you give credit
for. <!-- 29-Dec-2021 --></li>
<li>Happiness is not something that you can make in a factory.
<!-- 29-Mar-2022 --></li>
<li>What's the point of a city being rich and prosperous, if it cannot
defend itself from an attack? Others will plunder it and leave only
rabbles behind. Replace city with person, and it still holds true.
<!-- 07-Jun-2022 --></li>
<li>A truly selfish person is incapable of recognizing selfishness in
others. Anyone accusing another of being selfish is himself selfish.
<!-- 30-Jul-2022, updated: 02-Jan-2023 --></li>
<li>Don't trust anyone too much. They will exploit it. That's just human
nature. <!-- 16-Aug-2022 -->
<ul>
<li>Sort of like 'don't put all your eggs in one basket'.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be weary of people who are too nice. It's probably too good to be
true. <!-- 01-Sep-2022 --></li>
<li>It's not the things that happen to us that decide our future, but
the manner in which we react to them. <!-- 17-Sep-2022 --></li>
<li>Amount of happiness experienced by everyone is the same.
<!-- 17-Sep-2022 --></li>
<li>You may fall down, but each time you fall down, stand back up. Being
robust is better than always being correct. <!-- 23-Sep-2022 --></li>
<li>Ability to restrain one's anger is a measure of his emotional
maturity. <!-- 11-Oct-2022 about ppk's extraordinary patience --></li>
<li>Whatever you are doing, no matter whether it's considered good or
bad by others or yourself, do it with all your heart.
<!-- 03-Nov-2022 Inspired by Mengde --></li>
<li>It's easier to give good advice than to actually follow the self
same advice. <!-- 02-Jan-2023 --></li>
<li>I guess time flies only if you are wasting it..
<!-- 20-Jan-2023 --></li>
<li>ബൈബിളില്‍ പ്രതിപാദിക്കുന്ന പത്തു കല്‍പനകളില്‍ കള്ളം പറയരുതെന്നില്ല, പക്ഷേ കള്ളസാക്ഷ്യം
പറയരുതെന്നുണ്ട് താനും. അതു സമൂഹത്തില്‍ ചെറിയ തോതിലുള്ള നുണ പറച്ചില്‍ അനിവാര്യമാണെന്നുള്ളതിന്റെ
ഒരു അംഗീകാരമല്ലേ? <!-- 23-Jan-2023 --></li>
<li>Someone who is happy that you are nearby, no matter how accomplished
or influential you are. That would be nice. Can that be a friend? Not
exactly, I guess. But that can be a mentee. For whom you are the mentor.
You can't expect any support from them. You'll be <em>their</em>
support. <!-- 22-Feb-2023 --></li>
<li>Those who look like they can be bullied will be bullied.
<!-- 05-Apr-2023 --></li>
<li>A poor man is more likely to know who his real friends are when
compared to a rich man.
<!-- 08-Apr-2023. Donald Trump once said something like this. --></li>
<li>Fire from within endures more than the one without.
<!-- 09-May-2023 --></li>
<li>I find music to be like a drug. Take too much of it, and you suffer.
<!-- 05-Jun-2023 --></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One needs an adversity to know who their real friends are.
<!-- 13-Jul-2023 --></li>
<li>The best Christmases are those when we weren't forced to go to
Church! <!-- 10-Aug-2023 --></li>
<li>Documentation is best when examples are included.
<!-- 25-Sep-2023 --></li>
<li>Happy is the man who can make his mother laugh. Fortunate is the man
who can make his father proud. <!-- 03-Nov-2023 --></li>
