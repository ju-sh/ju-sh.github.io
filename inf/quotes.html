<blockquote>
<p>He said that one of the most important things he learned over the
years was to be prepared to acknowledge his mistakes and to correct them
quickly - without dwelling on the past. "You failed? Correct it and move
on. And that also applies to success. I don’t think it is right to dwell
too much on what has happened because time changes very quickly.
<strong>The important thing is to focus on the present and plan for the
future, in accordance with the current situation.</strong> You can’t win
every battle. The important thing is to keep going." … … Kreiz
recommended to students in the audience that they plan their future with
a focus on innovation. "It doesn’t matter what you are doing or at what
level. <strong>You can always do things better, in a more innovative
way</strong>. That’s the way to stand out and move forward."</p>

<p><strong>Think - but to a purpose. Think constructively.</strong>
Think as you read. Think as you listen. Think as you travel and your
eyes reveal new situations. Think as you work daily at your desk, or in
the field, or while strolling. Think to rise and improve your place in
life. There can be no advancement or success without serious

<li><p>J. K. Rowling in her Harvard commencement speech 2008<a
href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/06/text-of-j-k-rowling-speech/">ʳ</a>:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not blame my parents for their point of view. *There is an
expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong
direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel,
responsibility lies with you.*<br />
…</p>
<p>Climbing out of poverty by your own efforts, that is indeed something
on which to pride yourself, but poverty itself is romanticised only by
fools.<br />
…</p>
<p>So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because
failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending
to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct
all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I
really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the
determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I
was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was
still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old
typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid
foundation on which I rebuilt my life.</p>
<p>You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is
inevitable. <strong>It is impossible to live without failing at
something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have
lived at all – in which case, you fail by default.</strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I hope that even if you remember not a single word of mine, you
remember those of Seneca, another of those old Romans I met when I fled
down the Classics corridor, in retreat from career ladders, in search of
ancient wisdom: <strong>As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is,
but how good it is, is what matters</strong>.</p>

*To love someone long-term is to attend a thousand funerals of the
people they used to be.*<br />
The people they’re too exhausted to be any longer.<br />
The people they don’t recognize inside themselves anymore.<br />
The people they grew out of, the people they never ended up growing
into.<br />
We so badly want the people we love to get their spark back when it
burns out;<br />
to become speedily found when they are lost.<br />
But it is not our job to hold anyone accountable to the people they used
to be.<br />
It is our job to travel with them between each version and to honor what
emerges along the way.<br />
Sometimes it will be an even more luminescent flame.<br />
Sometimes it will be a flicker that disappears and temporarily floods
the room with a perfect and necessary darkness.<br />

<pre><code>A wise man, met a young man on the road who was travelling from his home town to move to a new town. The young man asked, &quot;Sir, how did you find the people in the other town?&quot;

The wise man asked him, &quot;How did you find the people at the place where you came from?&quot;

The young man replied, &quot;They are all no good; they lie, cheat, steal, and are lazy.&quot;

The wise man said, &quot;I think you will find that the people in the new town are much the same&quot;.

Later, the wise man encountered a second traveller going in the same direction as the young man.
The traveller asked the same question as the other young man had posed.

Again the wise man asked him how he found the people in the town where he was coming from.

The traveller replied, &quot;They are great, hard working, honest, loving people.&quot;

The wise man answered, &quot;I think you will find them to be the same&quot;.
