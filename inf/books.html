<h2 id="the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin"><em>The autobiography of
Benjamin Franklin</em></h2>
<p>Quote found on book's cover:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either write something worth reading or do something worth
writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="value-of-money">Value of money</h3>
<p>One needs money to be stable. Hard to stick to morals when one is
totally broke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Poverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: <strong>'Tis
hard for an empty Bag to stand upright.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It's hard for an empty sack to stand upright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—</p>
<p>Need for lying often comes from outstanding debt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second Vice is Lying, the first is running in Debt.<br />
<strong>Lying rides upon Debt's Back.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>—</p>
<p>പലതുള്ളി പെരുവെള്ളം. A little indulgence every now and then eventually
adds up to a large expense. Both in terms of time and money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What maintains a vice would bring up two children.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many a little makes a mickle.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="need-for-hard-work">Need for hard work</h3>
<p>Hope for good but work for it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon Hope will die
fasting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He that hath a Trade hath an Estate; and he that hath a Calling, hath
an Office of Profit and Honor; but then <strong>the Trade must be worked
at, and the Calling well followed</strong>, or neither the Estate nor
the Office will enable us to pay our Taxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="time-for-self">Time for self</h3>
<p>Work for living. Don't live to work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drive thy Business, let not that drive thee</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy, wealthy, and
wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="value-of-time">Value of time</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>do not squander Time, for that's the stuff life is made of.</p>
<p>The sleeping Fox catches no poultry.</p>
<p>There will be sleeping enough in the grave, as Poor Richard says.</p>
<p>If Time be of all Things the most precious, wasting Time must be the
greatest prodigality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were a Servant, would you not be ashamed that a good Master
should catch you idle? Are you then your own Master, <strong>be ashamed
to catch yourself idle</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One To-day is worth two To-morrows, and farther, Have you somewhat to
do To-morrow, do it To-day.</p>

<h3 id="more">More</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>these disputing, confuting and contradicting people are generally
unfortunate in their affairs. <strong>They get victory sometimes, but
they never get good will, which would be of more use to
them.</strong></p>

<p>General Shirley, who took command from Braddock, after having Loudoun
succeed his position as commander of army in America:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one
among them very low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley. Perceiving it
as I sat by him, I said, "They have given you, sir, too low a seat." "No
matter," says he, "Mr. Franklin, <strong>I find a low seat the
easiest</strong>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Less responsibility is easier. But I wonder if it's always worth
it..</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Focus on one thing at a time. Finish the things you start.</p>
<p>Look at how Franklin went about attaining his 13 goals to attain
perfection in morality. He went about it by focusing on one goal per
week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>like him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate
all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his
strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having
accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped,
the encouraging pleasure of seeing [..] the progress I made</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—</p>
<p>Franklin waiting for a letter from a General meeting a messenger
annoyed by the General delaying providing of another letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for
his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready."</p>
<p>"Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? for I see him
constantly at his escritoire."</p>
<p>"Yes," says Innis, "but he is like St. George on the signs,
<strong>always on horseback, and never rides on.</strong>"</p>
<p>This observation of the messenger was, it seems, well founded; for,
when in England, I understood that Mr. Pitt gave it as one reason for
removing this general, and sending Generals Amherst and Wolfe, that
<strong>the minister never heard from him, and could not know what he
was doing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of how a PhD supervisor might feel like when a student
goes incommunicado or does not progress.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Danger of appearing too faultless. Not sure if I got this out of
context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being
envied and hated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in
himself, to keep his friends in countenance.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Franklin's brother James was furious when he realized Silence Dogood
letters were written by Benjamin.
<ul>
<li>James considered Benjamin only as an apprentice. Apparently didn't
want Ben to grow 'bigger' than James.</li>
<li>Ben eventually had to flee to New York (and then to Philadelphia) to
further his future.</li>
<li>Eventually, after it became clear that Franklin was much prosperous
than himself, James made up with Benjamin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Franklin is eager to get credit for his actions. He seems
disappointed if someone took advantage of his efforts. Like all
humans.</li>
<li>DBT: I wonder what Socarates style of argumentation is..</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be confident</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong>
<ul>
<li>Plan your day, your finance and your life.</li>
<li>Like how Mukesh Ambani executed his plan to launch Jio.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each day, resolve what to do in the morning and examine how it went
at night.</li>

<h2 id="rules-for-life---jordan-b.-peterson"><em>12 rules for life</em>
- Jordan B. Peterson</h2>
<p>Didn't finish reading. Too verbose. Could have been much more
concise. But I liked some of the 'rules':</p>
<ul>
<li>Rule 1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back</li>
<li>Rule 2. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for
helping</li>
<li>Rule 3. Make friends with people who want the best for you</li>
<li>Rule 4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who
someone else is today</li>
</ul>

<li>Envelope1: The sentences on the two envelopes are both false</li>
<li>Envelope2: The dime is in the other envelope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>Consider sentence on envelope1.</p>
<p>Two cases.</p>
<p>If sentence on envolope1 was true, then both sentences are false. But
that includes sentence1 as well. =&gt; Contradiction.</p>
<p>So sentence1 can't true. It must be false (assuming law of excluded
middle, I guess). That means at least one of the two sentences is
true.</p>
<p>So, sentence2 is true.</p>
<p>∴ the coin is in the 1st envolope.</p>
<hr />
<p>m: has money e: is empty a: 1st envolope b: 2nd envolope</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[m(a) ∧ e(b)] ∨ [e(a) ∧ m(b)]</p></li>
<li><p>Envolope1: ¬a ∨ ¬b</p></li>
<li><p>Envolope2: m(b)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If S1 is false, either ¬a ∧ ¬b or a ∧ b</p>
<p>If ¬a ∧ ¬b:</p>
<ul>
<li>m(b) is false</li>
<li>contradiction since we know one envolope has money</li>
</ul>
<p>If a ∧ b:</p>
<ul>
<li>m(b) is true. ie, S2 is true</li>
</ul>
<p>So money is in envolope2.</p>
<p>If S1 is true, either ¬a ∧ b or a ∧ ¬b</p>
<p>If ¬a ∧ b:</p>
<ul>
<li>contradiction ∵ we just said S1 is true</li>
</ul>
<p>If a ∧ ¬b:</p>
<ul>
<li>¬m(b)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since exactly one envolope has money. m(a)</p>
<p>Huh…?</p>
