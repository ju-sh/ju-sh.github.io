he who sleeps, does not sin;<br />
he who does not sin is a saint;<br />

<li>An old law joke: <a

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A lawyer bought a box of very rare and expensive cigars, then insured
them against fire. A month later, after smoking all the cigars, he filed
a claim against the insurance company, claiming that the cigars had been
destroyed 'in a series of small fires'. Naturally, the insurance company
refused to pay, arguing that he had consumed the cigars in the normal
way. The lawyer sued and won. The judge concluded that, on the wording
of the policy, the insurance company was liable - it had failed to limit
its liability by defining what would amount to an 'unacceptable
fire'.</p>
<p>The company, rather than incur the costs of appeal, paid up $15,000,
whereupon it reported the lawyer to the police. He was arrested and
subsequently convicted on 24 counts of arson - intentionally burning
insured property - and sentenced to two years' imprisonment and a
fine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Jewish businessman in Chicago sent his son to Israel for a year to
absorb the culture.<br />
When the son returned, he said, "Papa, I had a great time in Israel. By
the way, I converted to Christianity."</p>
<p>"Oy vey," said the father. "What have I done?" He took his problem to
his best friend, Ike.</p>
<p>"Ike," he said, "I sent my son to Israel, and he came home a
Christian. What can I do?"</p>
<p>"Funny you should ask," said Ike. "I too, sent my son to Israel, and
he also came home a Christian. Perhaps we should go see the rabbi."</p>
<p>So they did, and they explained their problem to the rabbi.</p>
<p>"Funny you should ask," said the rabbi. "I, too, sent my son to
Israel, and he also came home a Christian. What is happening to our
young people?"</p>
<p>And so they all prayed, telling God about their sons…</p>
<p>Then, a voice came from the Heavens: "Funny you should ask," said the
voice… "I, too, sent my Son to Israel…"</p>

<li>A meme that gained currency among the employees of an IT company
when their HR policy got updated:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>DRESS CODE<br />
You are advised to come to work dressed according to your salary. If we
see you wearing prada shoes, carrying a gucci bag, we will assume you
are doing well financially and therefore do not need a raise. If you
dress poorly, you need to learn to manage your money better, so that you
may buy nice clothes and therefore you do not need a raise. If you dress
just right, you are right where you needed to be and therefore you do
not need a raise.</p>
<p>SICK LEAVE<br />
We will no longer accept a doctor's statement as a proof of sickness. If
you are able to go the doctor, you are able to come to work too. Only a
death certificate is acceptable. That too, would be valid only till the
funeral. You'd have to continue office work after funeral.</p>
<p>CASUAL LEAVE<br />
Each employee will receive 104 personal days a year. They would be
called saturdays and sundays.</p>
<p>BATHROOM BREAKS<br />
Too much time is being spent in the toilet, and the employees feel proud
that they are being paid to poop. There is now a strict 3-minute limit
in the stalls. At the end of 3 minutes, an alarm will sound, the toilet
paper and shower will retract, stall door will open and a picture will
be taken. After your second offense, your picture will be posted on the
company's bulletin board under the 'chronic offenders' category. Anyone
caught smiling in the picure will be sectioned under the company's
mental health policy.</p>
<p>LUNCH BREAK<br />
Skinny people get 30 minutes for lunch, as they need to eat more, so
that they can look healthy. Normal people get 15 minutes for lunch to
get a meal good enough to keep them alive in their average figure.
Chubby people get 5 mintues for lunch, because that' all the time needed
to drink a a Slim-Fast.</p>

Although the reviews were not entirely negative, it is evident that
the manuscript does not meet our criteria for novelty and impact.

<p>Nasreddin had a leaky ferry-boat, and used it to row people across
the river. One day his passenger was a fussy schoolteacher, and on the
way across he decided to give Nasreddin a test and see how much he
knew.<br />
"Tell me, Nasreddin, what are eight sixes?"<br />
"I've no idea."<br />
"How do you spell magnificence?"<br />
"I don't."<br />
"Didn't you study anything at school?"<br />
"No."<br />
"In that case, half your life is lost."<br />
Just then a fierce storm blew up, and the boat began to sink.<br />
"Tell me, schoolteacher," said Nasreddin. "Did you ever learn to
swim?"<br />
"No."<br />
"In that case, your whole life is lost."</p>
