<p>How many roads must a man walk down<br />
Before you call him a man?<br />
Yes, n how many seas must a white dove sail<br />
Before she sleeps in the sand?<br />
Yes, n how many times must the cannon balls fly<br />
Before they’re forever banned?<br />
The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind,<br />
The answer is blowin’ in the wind.</p>
<p>How many years can a mountain exist<br />
Before its washed to the sea?<br />
Yes, n how many years can some people exist<br />
Before they’re allowed to be free?<br />
Yes, n how many times can a man turn his head,<br />
Pretending he just doesn’t see?<br />
The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind,<br />
The answer is blowin’ in the wind.</p>
<p>How many times must a man look up<br />
Before he can see the sky?<br />
Yes, n how many ears must one man have<br />
Before he can hear people cry?<br />
Yes, n how many deaths will it take till he knows<br />
That too many people have died?<br />
The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind,<br />
The answer is blowin’ in the wind.</p>
