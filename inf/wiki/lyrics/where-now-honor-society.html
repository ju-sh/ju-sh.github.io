<div id="content-container">
<p>To my favorite teacher<br />
Who told me never give up<br />
To my 5th grade crush<br />
Who I thought I really loved<br />
To the guys I missed<br />
And the girls we kissed<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>To my ex-best friends<br />
Don’t know how we grew apart<br />
To my favorite band<br />
And sing-alongs in my car<br />
To the face I see<br />
In my memories<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>Where are you now?<br />
Cause I’m thinking of you<br />
You showed me how<br />
How to live like I do<br />
If it wasn’t for you<br />
I would never be who I am.</p>
<p>To my first girlfriend<br />
I thought for sure was the one<br />
To my last girlfriend<br />
Sorry that I screwed it up<br />
To the ones I loved<br />
But didn’t show it enough<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>Where are you now?<br />
Cause I’m thinking of you<br />
You showed me how,<br />
how to live like I do<br />
If it wasn’t for you<br />
I would never be who I am.</p>
<p>And I’ll never see those days again<br />
And things will never be that way again<br />
But that’s just how it goes,<br />
People change, but I know<br />
I won’t forget you.</p>
<p>To the ones who cared<br />
And who were there from the start<br />
To the love that left<br />
and took a piece of my heart<br />
To the few who’d swear<br />
I’d never go anywhere<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>Where are you now?<br />
Cause I’m thinking of you<br />
You showed me how<br />
How to live like I do<br />
If it wasn’t for you<br />
I would never be who I am.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for you<br />
I would never be who I am<br />
If it wasn’t for you<br />
I’d be nothing<br />
Where are you now?</p>
