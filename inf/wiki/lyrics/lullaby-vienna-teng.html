<p>Little child, be not afraid<br />
Though rain pounds harshly against the glass<br />
Like an unwanted stranger, there is no danger<br />
I am here tonight</p>
<p>Little child, be not afraid<br />
Though thunder explodes and lightning flash<br />
Illuminates your tear-stained face<br />
I am here tonight</p>
<p>And someday you’ll know<br />
That nature is so<br />
The same rain that draws you near me<br />
Falls on rivers and land<br />
On forests and sand<br />
Makes the beautiful world that you’ll see<br />
In the morning</p>
<p>Little child, be not afraid<br />
Though storm clouds mask your beloved moon<br />
And its candlelight beams, still keep pleasant dreams<br />
I am here tonight</p>
<p>Little child, be not afraid<br />
Though wind makes creatures of our trees<br />
And their branches to hands, they’re not real, understand<br />
And I am here tonight</p>
<p>And someday you’ll know<br />
That nature is so<br />
The same rain that draws you near me<br />
Falls on rivers and land<br />
On forests and sand<br />
Makes the beautiful world that you’ll see<br />
In the morning</p>
<p>For you know, once even I was a<br />
Little child, and I was afraid<br />
But a gentle someone always came<br />
To dry all my tears, trade sweet sleep for fears<br />
And to give a kiss goodnight</p>
<p>Well now I am grown<br />
And these years have shown<br />
That rain’s a part of how life goes<br />
But it’s dark and it’s late<br />
So I’ll hold you and wait<br />
’Til your frightened eyes do close</p>
<p>And I hope that you’ll know<br />
That nature is so<br />
The same rain that draws you near me<br />
Falls on rivers and land<br />
On forests and sand<br />
Makes the beautiful world that you’ll see<br />
In the morning</p>
<p>Everything’s fine in the morning<br />
The rain’ll be gone in the morning<br />
But I’ll still be here in the morning</p>
