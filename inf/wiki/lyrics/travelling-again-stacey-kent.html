<hr />
<p>I wish I could go travelling again<br />
It feels like the summer will never end<br />
And I've had such good offers from several of my friends<br />
I wish I could go travelling again</p>
<p>I want to sit in my shades sipping my latte<br />
Beneath the awning of a famous café<br />
Jet-lagged and with our luggage gone astray<br />
I wish I could go travelling again</p>
<p>I want a waiter to give us a reprimand<br />
In a language neither of us understand<br />
While we argue about the customs of the land<br />
I wish I could go travelling again</p>
<p>I want to sit in traffic, anxious about our plane<br />
While you blasé comments drive me half insane<br />
I want to dash for shelter with you through the tropical rain<br />
I wish I could go travelling again</p>
<p>I want to be awakened by a faulty fire alarm<br />
In an overpriced hotel devoid of charm<br />
Then fall asleep again back in your arms<br />
I wish I could go travelling again</p>
<p>But how can I ever go travelling again<br />
When I know I'll just keep remembering again<br />
When I know I'll just be gathering again<br />
Reminders to break my heart</p>
<p>I wish I could go travelling again<br />
It fells like this summer will never end<br />
And I've had such good offers from several of my friends</p>
