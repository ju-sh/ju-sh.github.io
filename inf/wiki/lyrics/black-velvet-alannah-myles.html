<hr />
<p>Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell,<br />
Jimmy Rodgers on the Victrola up high<br />
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder,<br />
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky.</p>
<p>The boy could sing, knew how to move ev'rything,<br />
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for..</p>
<p>Black velvet and that little boy smile.<br />
Black velvet with that slow southern style.<br />
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees.<br />
Black velvet, if you please.</p>
<p>Up in Memphis the music's like a heat wave<br />
White Lightnin' bound to drive you wild,<br />
Mama's baby's in the heart of ev'ry school girl,<br />
Love Me Tender leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle.</p>
<p>The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true,<br />
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for..</p>
<p>Black velvet and that little boy smile.<br />
Black velvet with that slow southern style.<br />
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees.<br />
Black velvet, if you please..</p>
<p>Ev'ry word of ev'ry song that he sang was for you,<br />
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon,<br />
What could you do?</p>
<p>Black velvet and that little boy smile.<br />
Black velvet with that slow southern style.<br />
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees.<br />
Black velvet, if you please..</p>
<p>Black velvet and that little boy smile.<br />
Black velvet with that slow southern style.<br />
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees.<br />
Black velvet, if you please..<br />
If you please, If you please, if you please..</p>
