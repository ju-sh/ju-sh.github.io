<p>We waited all through the year<br />
For the day to appear<br />
When we could be together in harmony<br />
 <br />
You know the time will come<br />
Peace on earth for everyone<br />
And we could live forever in a world where we are free<br />
Let it shine for you and me<br />
 <br />
There’s something about Christmas time<br />
Something about Christmas time<br />
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday<br />
 <br />
To see the joy in the children’s eyes<br />
The way that the old folks smile<br />
It makes you wish it was Christmas everyday<br />
 <br />
I know it’s not too late<br />
The world would be a better place<br />
If we could keep the spirit more than one day in the year<br />
Send a message loud and clear<br />
 <br />
There’s something about Christmas time<br />
Something about Christmas time<br />
That makes you wish it was Christmas everyday<br />
 <br />
To see the joy in the children’s eyes<br />
The way that the old folks smile<br />
It makes you wish it was Christmas everyday<br />
 <br />
It’s the time of year when everyone’s together<br />
We’ll celebrate here on Christmas day<br />
When the ones you love are there<br />
You can feel the magic in the air - you know it’s everywhere<br />
 <br />
There’s something about Christmas time<br />
Something about Christmas time<br />
That makes you wish it was Christmas every day<br />
(x2)<br />
 <br />
To see the joy in the children’s eyes<br />
The way that the old folks smile<br />
Just makes you wish it was Christmas every day</p>
