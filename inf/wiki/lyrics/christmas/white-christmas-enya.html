<hr />
<p>Have you seen the mistletoe?<br />
It fills the night with kisses.<br />
Have you seen the bright new star?<br />
It fills your heart with wishes.<br />
Have you seen the candlelight?<br />
It shines from every window.<br />
Have you seen the moon above?<br />
It lights the sky in silver.</p>
<p>Green is in the mistletoe<br />
and red is in the holly,<br />
silver in the stars above<br />
that shine on everybody.<br />
Gold is in the candlelight and<br />
crimson in the embers.<br />
White is in the winter night<br />
that everyone remembers.</p>
<p>Have you heard the boys all sigh<br />
when all the girls are skating?<br />
Have you heard the sweetheart’s cry<br />
for all this time they’re waiting?</p>
<p>Green is in the mistletoe<br />
and red is in the holly,<br />
silver in the stars above<br />
that shine on everybody.<br />
Gold is in the candlelight and<br />
crimson in the embers.<br />
White is in the winter night<br />
that everyone remembers.</p>
<p>Have you seen the children playing? Tiny hands are frozen!<br />
Have you seen them hurry home when suddenly it’s snowing!</p>
<p>Green is in the mistletoe<br />
and red is in the holly,<br />
silver in the stars above<br />
that shine on everybody.<br />
Gold is in the candlelight and<br />
crimson in the embers.<br />
White is in the winter night<br />
that everyone remembers.</p>
<p>Have you heard the bells are ringing,<br />
ringing out their story?<br />
Have you heard the choir singing?<br />
Glory! Glory! Glory!</p>
