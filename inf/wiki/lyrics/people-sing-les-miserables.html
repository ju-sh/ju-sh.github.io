<p>Do you hear the people sing?<br />
Singing the song of angry men?<br />
It is the music of the people<br />
Who will not be slaves again!<br />
When the beating of your heart<br />
Echoes the beating of the drums<br />
There is a life about to start<br />
When tomorrow comes!</p>
<p>Will you join in our crusade?<br />
Who will be strong and stand with me?<br />
Beyond the barricade<br />
Is there a world you long to see?</p>
<p>Then join in the fight<br />
That will give you the right to be free!</p>
<p>Do you hear the people sing?<br />
Singing the song of angry men?<br />
It is the music of the people<br />
Who will not be slaves again!<br />
When the beating of your heart<br />
Echoes the beating of the drums<br />
There is a life about to start<br />
When tomorrow comes!</p>
<p>Will you give all you can give<br />
So that our banner may advance?<br />
Some will fall and some will live<br />
Will you stand up and take your chance?<br />
The blood of the martyrs<br />
Will water the meadows of France!</p>

<h2 id="reprise">Reprise</h2>
<p>Do you hear the people sing?<br />
Lost in the valley of the night<br />
It is the music of a people<br />
Who are climbing to the light</p>
<p>For the wretched of the earth<br />
There is a flame that never dies<br />
Even the darkest night will end<br />
And the sun will rise.</p>
<p>They will live again in freedom<br />
In the garden of the Lord<br />
We will walk behind the plowshare<br />
We will put away the sword<br />
The chain will be broken<br />
And all men will have their reward!</p>
<p>Will you join in our crusade?<br />
Who will be strong and stand with me?<br />
Somewhere beyond the barricade<br />
Is there a world you long to see?<br />
Do you hear the people sing?<br />
Say, do you hear the distant drums?<br />
It is the future that we bring<br />
When tomorrow comes!<br />
Will you join in our crusade?<br />
Who will be strong and stand with me?<br />
Somewhere beyond the barricade<br />
Is there a world you long to see?<br />
Do you hear the people sing<br />
Say, do you hear the distant drums?<br />
It is the future that we bring<br />
When tomorrow comes!<br />
Tomorrow comes!<br />
Tomorrow comes!</p>
