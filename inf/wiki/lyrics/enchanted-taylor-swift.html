<hr />
<p>There I was again tonight<br />
forcing laughter, faking smiles;<br />
same old tired, lonely place.</p>
<p>Walls of insincerity,<br />
shifting eyes and vacancy<br />
vanished when I saw your face</p>
<p>All I can say is it was<br />
enchanting to meet you…</p>
<p>Your eyes whispered, 'Have we met?'<br />
Across the room your silhouette<br />
starts to make its way to me.</p>
<p>The playful conversation starts,<br />
counter all your quick remarks<br />
like passing notes in secrecy.</p>
<p>And it was enchanting to meet you.<br />
All I can say is I was<br />
enchanted to meet you…</p>
<p>This night is sparkling, don't you let it go.<br />
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home.<br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet
you…</p>
<p>The lingering question kept me up,<br />
2 AM, who do you love?<br />
I wondered til I'm wide awake…</p>
<p>And now I'm pacing back and forth,<br />
wishing you were at my door.<br />
I'd open up and you would say, 'Hey,<br />
It was enchanting to meet you…'<br />
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you…</p>
<p>This night is sparkling, don't you let it go.<br />
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home.<br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew…</p>
<p>This night is flawless, don't you let it go.<br />
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone.<br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br />
I was enchanted to meet you…</p>
<p>This is me praying that<br />
this was the very first page,<br />
not where the storyline ends.</p>
<p>My thoughts will echo your name<br />
until I see you again.<br />
These are the words I held back<br />
as I was leaving too soon,<br />
'I was enchanted to meet you…'.</p>
<p>Please don't be in love with someone else.<br />
Please don't have somebody waiting on you. x2</p>
<p>This night is sparkling, don't you let it go.<br />
I'm wonder-struck, blushing all the way home.<br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew…</p>
<p>This night is flawless, don't you let it go.<br />
I'm wonder-struck, dancing around all alone.<br />
I'll spend forever wondering if you know<br />
I was enchanted to meet you…</p>
<p>Please don't be in love with someone else.<br />
Please don't have somebody waiting on you.</p>
