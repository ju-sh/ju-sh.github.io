<p>Why do people get married and start families?</p>
<p>I suppose there are many reasons. Ranging from emotional to financial
ones.</p>
<p>Why do people choose to have children?</p>
<p>Is it for the good of the children?</p>
<p>Can’t be, since the children don’t exist yet.</p>
<p>Then for whom?</p>
<p>Well, I guess children are made because the prospective parents want
them.</p>
<p>Why do parents want children?</p>
<p>To instill some meaning into their life. To make their lives less
monotonous.</p>
<p>Of course, there are pros and cons. Children can bring joy.. but also
misery.. (a lot of it).</p>
<p>Why do people buy and keep pets?</p>
<p>Because humans derive pleasure in giving affection.</p>
<p>It feels good to know that there is someone who depends on you. Feels
good, yeah. But it’s also a responsibility.</p>
<p>It’s also gives a feeling of power. A ‘god-like’ feeling.</p>
<p>Curiosity is also involved. The parents can take pride that they
single handedly created copies of themselves.<br />
They made life itself (at least in some way).</p>
<p>When the child is small, he’s cute to look at. He’s adorable,
helpless and can’t even talk. One can’t help but take care of him. Good
care of him.</p>
<p>The parents will find joy in teaching the child to talk, to walk…</p>
<p>Wait, back to our original question.</p>
<p>Why do parents make babies?</p>
<p>It’s not for the babies themselves, since they come into being only
if the parents choose to.</p>
<p>Parents want someone to take care of them when they get old.</p>
<p>Children are an investment.</p>
<p>Different kinds of parents expect different forms of return from the
investment they have made in the form of their children.</p>
<p>Some expect financial benefits once their children get jobs.. Others
emotional attachment in their old age.. Yet others right to boast how
their own children are superior to those of the people around them.. And
so on with many possibly combinations..</p>
<h2 id="parents-who-expect-financial-benefits">Parents who expect
financial benefits</h2>
<p>I have seen a fair share of this kind of parents.</p>
<p>They toil during their prime to make it possible for their children
to get an education (or whatever is needed) that will enable them to get
high-paying jobs.</p>
<p>The bound of their joy would be difficult to measure if and when what
they were aiming at comes true.</p>
<p>Some section of parents would then lose it and indulge themselves in
luxury with the money that their children generate. They may flaunt
their new-found wealth to their neighbours.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>Parents make babies solely for themselves.</p>
<p>But since everybody does it, they don’t say it aloud.</p>
