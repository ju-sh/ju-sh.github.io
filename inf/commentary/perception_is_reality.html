<p>You are whom you think you are. Whom you believe yourself to be.</p>
<p>As far as a person is concerned, things are the way that he thinks
they are.</p>
<p>As Shakespeare said, ‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder’.</p>
<p>Different people may define beauty in a different way.</p>
<p>No matter how messed up others may judge your life to be, if you
think it’s not so bad, then it isn’t so bad.</p>
<p>Motivational speakers sometimes advice people to tell themselves ‘I
can do it’ over and over again.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>To make you believe it. So that you will be confident. So that you
will see things differently. So that your perception of the world is
changed.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you consider yourselves to be doomed, you are
doomed.</p>
<!--
Soft skill trainers who prepare grad students for their first interview sometimes advise those who are nervous to consider themselves
-->
<p>Being able to live with oneself.</p>
<p>No matter how talented or capable a person is, if his confidence in
himself is lost, and he thinks himself to be a failure, he <em>is</em> a
failure.</p>
<p>It’s all a matter of perspective.</p>
<p>It is said that before its use (for which it is now well known) was
discovered, people considered land which oozed petroleum to be
useless.<br />
What was considered worthless back then is now something much sought
after (even to the extent of producing many violent conflicts).</p>
<p>Another story:<br />
A man once gave his son a watch and asked him to find how much the
watchmaker would give him for it.<br />
The son reported that watchmaker, considering its derelict state,
offered only a meagre sum.<br />
The father nodded and asked him to see what the musuem curator says. The
museum people identified it as an invaluable antique and offered a huge
sum for it.</p>
<p>What one person values, another may not.</p>
<p>Find those who would value and enhance you and avoid the other
category.</p>
<p>Remember that every coin has a flip side.</p>
<p>If there’s pain, there’s also joy. And vice-versa.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s still not always easy to bring yourself to believe in
yourselves.</p>
<p>That’s the importance of good friends.</p>
<p>A safety social net of some sort. People who might be there to lend a
helping hand if you go off course.</p>
