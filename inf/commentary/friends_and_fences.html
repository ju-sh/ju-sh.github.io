<p>As Zhuge Liang said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The acquaintance of honourable people, even at a distance, <em>does
not add flowers in times of warmth and does not change its leaves in
times of cold</em>: it <em>continues unfading through the four
seasons</em>, becomes increasingly stable as it passes through ease and
danger.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strength and loyalty of such a friendship isn’t affected by your
changing fortunes.</p>
<p>At least in some ways, such a friend doesn’t expect anything in
return for their help.</p>
<p>Such a friend would stand by you the same in times of prosperity and
adversity alike.</p>
<p>And as time goes on, the bond grows stronger. Increasingly stable, as
Zhuge Liang put it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A faithful friend is a sure shelter. He who has found one, has found
a rare treasure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does a stable friendship begin?</p>
<p>It is not planned. It just happens.</p>
<p>Because if was planned, the acquaintance was made for a reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have three types of friends in life: Friends for a reason,
friends for a season, and friends for a lifetime. <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/5318529.Ziad_K_Abdelnour">¹</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aim for the last one. The other two are temporary and hence less
likely to last long.</p>
<p>Friends for a reason: most common form of companionship. Formed with
a particular aim in mind. Dissolved as soon as the aim is fulfilled or
it becomes evident that it cannot come to fruition.</p>
<p>Friends for a season: quite common in workplaces. Can seem like an
acquaintance that would last long, but usually doesn’t.</p>
<p>A great friend is someone who can stand your imperfections and whose
imperfections you can stand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never explain yourselves. Your friends don’t need it and your enemies
won’t believe you anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world’s yet to see a perfect human. (And is unlikely to see too,
considering that ‘perfect’ is defined differently by different groups of
people).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only people worthy to be in your life are the ones that help you
through the hard times and laugh with you after the hard times pass. <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/5318529.Ziad_K_Abdelnour">²</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember, everything has a limit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love your neighbour, but don’t pull down the fence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s won’t do to be distant mentally when near physically.</p>
<p>But it won’t do good to be too close either. Everything in excess
amount is harmful, and human relations are no exception.</p>
<p>A middle ground would be best.. That’s a healthy relationship.</p>
<p>There’s this Malayalam proverb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ചങ്ങാതി നന്നായാല്‍ കണ്ണാടി വേണ്ട.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>English translation would be like ‘you don’t need a mirror if you
have a good friend’.</p>
