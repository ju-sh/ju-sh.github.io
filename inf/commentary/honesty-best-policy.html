<p>What is the thing that we all strive for? Is it money? Is it
power?</p>
<p>Can’t claim to know the answer to that one..</p>
<p>Contentment. That’s what we seek.</p>
<p>Contentment in all aspects.</p>
<p>Happiness, relationshipts, wealth.</p>
<p>The richest and the poorest person could be the same in terms of
personal wealth if they are both content with what they have got.</p>
<p>Though stereotype is in favour of the rich usually being less content
with what they have, possibly because there is more opportunity for them
to make more money.</p>
<p>Whereas the poor may find it easier to be content with what they
have, possibly because they see no chance to make more money.</p>
<p>It is rightfully said that new found wealth is detrimental to one’s
peace of mind.</p>
<p>Peace of mind.</p>
<p>For peace of mind, honesty is the best policy.</p>
<p>One should be able to live with oneselves.</p>
