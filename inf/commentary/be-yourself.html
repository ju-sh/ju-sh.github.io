<blockquote>
<p>Never hide your bad side to make someone stay. Show your bad side and
see who can stay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you choose to pretend to be somebody you aren’t to be in the good
books of someone, remember that You can’t always be that someone
else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s better to be hated for who you are than be loved for who you are
not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be yourself. The people who are worth being in your life are those
like for who you are, not who they want you to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t chase people. Be yourself, do your own thing and work hard. The
right people will come to you and stay. <a

<p>I found the following passage sometime ago but forget from where I
got it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… nothing that is meant for you will ever get away. Love deeply, and
without the need to possess or own; let beautiful connections pass
through you without attachment, slam your heart into the people and the
places and the things that ignite something deep inside of your soul,
and I promise, I promise - the right things will stay. You will never
lose what is for you. Please don’t ever forget that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you strive for something, strive for it because you want to, not
because someone else wanted you to.</p>
<p>You are not likely to do great job if you yourself are not convinced
that what you are doing is what you need to do.</p>
<p>Accept advice from experienced people whom you can trust, but still
don’t fool yourself into thinking that every advice is something that
you should necessarily follow.</p>
