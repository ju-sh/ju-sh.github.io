<p>A poem that I wrote..</p>
<hr />
<p>Once upon a time during corona,<br />
Imprisoned at home in qurarantine with stigma,<br />
Lonely with thoughts grim and gloom,<br />
When in came a grasshopper green.</p>
<p>Through the window open did he come flying,<br />
Towards me did he come prying,<br />
Fearlessly did he hop onto my hand,<br />
Soothing me in my loneliness grand.</p>
<p>Twice welcome is help unexpected,<br />
As is a friend unexpected,<br />
Lonely prisoner craved a friend,<br />
And a friend did appear in his front.</p>
<p>Shaped like a bee with coat sembling a leaf,<br />
Alleviate did he my quarantine grief.<br />
Being my company the whole night lean,<br />
Fly away at dawn did my grasshopper green.</p>
