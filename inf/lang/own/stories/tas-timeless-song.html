<p>I was a bit annoyed that day. There was someone going around the
office asking what they would do if they had a time machine and could go
back in time. It sounded like a good way to waste other people's time if
anything. And I had work to do.</p>
<p>I left office</p>
<hr />
<p>I entered my room and opened my wardrobe to put away my things.
Inside of the wardrobe was a mess as usual. But I felt a sudden urge to
clean up. Although I knew full well that it would revert to its normal
state within a couple of days.</p>
<p>As I was rummaging about one of the shelves, I found something that
was once very dear to me, but had since been neglectedâ€¦ My diary. I used
to write in it almost every day for years. I had filled many diaries.
This was the last one.</p>
<p>I smiled. A smile of sadness maybe? A feeling of guilt that I hadn't
written anything in a long time? Or a smile of happiness? Because I knew
that I was holding a record of my past in my hands?</p>
<p>Either way, I opened it. I saw things that made me smile more. And
some things that made me sad. Then I saw something that had me hooked.
It was my 20 year old self mentioning something that the 15-year old me
had seen.</p>
<p>That made me smile broadly. Both outwards and in my mind.</p>
<p>Then I realized that I knew which point in my life would I relive for
a moment if I could.</p>
<p>It was to listen to Ta singing her song again.</p>
<p>Back when I was in 10th grade, after multiple prior attempts, my
family finally succeeded in carting me off to a hostel away from home so
that they didn't have to deal with me. They paid the hostel warden to
deal with me instead. I resented my parents for that.</p>
<p>We could go home once a month. I usually had no wish to go home. Why
hurry to meet those who didn't wish to have you around? But there was
something that attracted me back home: Computer games.</p>
<p>My siblings were all away at college. I could have the computer all
to myself. And at that age, I played video games whenever I could. That
was the only reason I went home for the holidays.</p>
<p>Staying back at hostel wasn't too bad actually. Because during the
holidays, most students would go home and only very few would remain.
Because of our small number, the wardens didn't bother us at all. We
could do whatever we wanted. There was no timetable to follow except for
food.</p>
<p>But the computer at home was always a way bigger attractive force. So
I went home almost every month. And as soon as reaching there, I would
switch on the computer. My family tolerated this. They understood full
well why I came home.</p>
<p>Once I went home as usual. I saw that my aunt and her two girls, my
little cousins, were there. Well, they are not little anymore, but they
were at the time. I liked to call them Na and Ta.</p>
<p>Na was elder, an intelligent and caring girl of around 10. Ta, the
younger, was not at all reserved and would say whatever that would come
to her mind. She was only around 4 at the time. Na used to be the
opposite of being reserved when she was of Ta's age, but she talked less
and listened more as she got older. Like a good big sister, she was
protective of Ta.</p>
<p>Na and Ta had come for a visit with their mother, my aunt, and were
staying the night. They hadn't known that I would be home that day. But
the kids were happy to see me. I was happy to see them too. They were
favourite cousins. But then I remembered that I couldn't be at my
computer without ignoring them. And I liked them enough to hate to
ignore them.</p>
<p>Na, being perceptive, realized that something was bothering me..
though she didn't talk to me about it. But Ta saw nothing of that and
was very happy to be near my mother and me with her family. We talked.
I, sometimes absent-mindedly with my eyes on the computer. Sometime
later, Ta was too excited to sit down. She began hopping all around us.
Half-dancing, half running. Finally she began singing. A song she
learned from her day care centre. I was thinking about other things to
notice it at the time, but it was truly a beautiful song. It wasn't the
lyrics that gave it beauty. But the way she sang it.. the way she was
laughed and smiled as sang, the way she looked at us. The way my mother
was watching her.</p>
<p>I used to say it was such a pity that we didn't record it. Although
we didn't have access to any recording devices in those days. But the
song is still fresh in my memory.. I even recall some of the lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beetle beetle, little beetle Won't you speeeak?!! Won't you speak to
meeee?!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She kept on singing till she was tired and my aunt made her go to
bed. She didn't want to, but obeyed her mother. She fell asleep quite
was slept. She was indeed tired. But she was happy. She slept with a
smile on her face.</p>
<p>I did switch on the computer afterwards, with Na. But I didn't feel
like playing games. I gave the computer to Na. She played a little, but
she didn't seem to enjoy it. Maybe Na realized what was bothering me
earlier then. I never asked. She was a sensible girl even at that tender
age. She understands people.</p>
<p>But I am sure the thought that I was annoyed at losing time with
computer never crossed Ta's mind. She was happy, very happy, as she was
singing.. Her song touched everyone who heard her. She was radiating
happiness. Now, I think of Ta's song. I am happy. For a moment, I forget
all my woes.. all my worries.. and am at peace..</p>
<p>I think Ta could sing such a song only because she was a child. A
sweet innocent child not yet corrupt by affectations that adults often
employ. Of course, Ta grew up. I doubt she would ever sing as she did
back then when she a child again.</p>
<p>I didn't realize the value of that time when it was still not past.
But I do now..</p>
<p>Ta's song is timeless.. A memory.. A sweet memory.. One that I would
always cherish.. Her song is a token of her childhood.. And mine..</p>
