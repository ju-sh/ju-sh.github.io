<p>My phone was ringing since how long I don’t know. By the time I woke
up, looked up the watch, searched for the phone in darkness the voice on
the other side was full of anger and exciting.</p>
<p>The minute I received the news I was awestruck. Neither the watch nor
the darkness nor even the silence in the home disturbed me except her
name which was ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>Is it true? Is she capable of doing such a thing? I had to believe it
as I received the news from her own mother.</p>
<p>My wife.. My son..</p>
<p>My son, killed by my wife? I don’t believe it. I just can’t.</p>
<p>Yet.. It was her own mother who just told me that. She was more angry
than sad. That means she is convinced of her daughter’s guilt and hates
her for it already.</p>
<p>Only last morning had I left her at her mother’s house. They had got
into some quarrel right away, but that was usual. I always considered
that as their way of showing affection to each other, however weird it
may be.</p>
<p>The air hadn’t cooled even when I left close to noon.</p>
<p>I had some urgent work to be done and a quiet home was the best fit
for that.</p>
<p>I did manage to do the pending work, attended a few meetings online,
and went to bed. I didn’t have dinner. Work had made me forget hunger.
And then I got the call from my mother-in-law.</p>
<p>Poisoned to death…</p>
<p>My wife, being a nurse, knows a lot about chemicals.</p>
<p>Even the main reason behind this visit to her mother’s was her wish
to check up on Ma’s health.</p>
<p>Ma, with her myriad health issues, has got a truck load of medicine.
Some of which she is taking solely on the advice of my wife. But Ma is
not as good at running a tidy house than she once was.</p>
<p>Even today when I was there, I found empty tablet strips strewn up
all over the place. I didn’t feel like cleaning up the mess, so I had
asked my wife to do it.</p>
<p>My wife, with her expertise good enough to be able to recommend
proper medicine to a patient without any help from a doctor, can
certainly differentiate between poisonous and non-poisonous
materials.</p>
<p>With that fact in mind, it’s difficult for me to convince myself that
my wife gave our son poison without realizing it.</p>
<p>Ma said that my wife confessed that she had poisoned our son, but had
second thoughts and wished to undo what she did. Neighbours rushed our
son to hospital but it was too late.</p>
<p>I sat on the bed for a while, overwhelmed with emotion. After a
while, I managed to calm myself enough to pull on a shirt and move
myself to the car.</p>
<p>I walked to the car. My body walked to the car. My mind was
elsewhere. My eyes saw the road in front of me, but I didn’t.</p>
<p>Habit and memories accrued over the years let me drive without paying
much attention.</p>
<p>The sight of the hospital with its huge red cross brought me back to
earth.</p>
<p>I got out. Found some familiar faces at the entrance. Heard someone
say something about the west wing. And I, like a piece of software that
someone engineered, began moving towards the west wing of the
hospital.</p>
<p>As I moved on a pair of eyes hooked on to mine.. and I saw my
wife.</p>
<p>Her face made plain the channels made by the streams of tears that
had emanated from her eyes. Her eyes seemed to have run out of
tears.</p>
<p>So she was sorry. She knew her crime. And its weight.</p>
<p>I had at first found it difficult to believe it. Not that difficult
now. Not with the guilty party standing right in front of me.</p>
<p>“Are you going to ask me why I killed our son?”, she demanded.</p>
<p>My face must have reflected what was going on in my mind.</p>
<p>“So you did do it..”, I replied through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>At this, she turned, threw what she had in her hand on the floor with
considerable force and walked away. I saw her face assuming a look of
deep disgust just before I lost sight of her.</p>
<p>Of all the nerve! She disposes of my son and acts as if I wronged
her.</p>
<p>Then I noticed the thing that she had thrown on the floor. It had
ricocheted off the wall and landed right beside my shoe.</p>
<p>I picked it up. A strip of tablets. The one Ma takes for one of her
illnesses. I recognized it as one among the many empty strips of tablets
that littered Ma’s house.</p>
<p>It was empty. I turned it over. Its expiry date was many years ago. I
looked at it more closely.</p>
<p>‘Keep away from children: poisonous in large quantities. Consumption
after expiry date hazardous to health. If taken, seek medical attention
immediately’</p>
<p>So this was the means by which she accomplished the deed. And she
kept it with her till now.</p>
<p>Suppressing tears, I was about to throw away the empty tablet strip
when I noticed some depressions on it. Teeth marks. Teeth marks of a
toddler! Of my son…</p>
<p>Then a sudden thought occurred. What if this strip wasn’t empty when
it was on Ma’s floor? The one that I was too lazy to pick up? What if my
son had taken it? What if my wife had found it and tried to get help but
was prevented from doing so due to her feud with her mother?</p>
<p>What weird thoughts..</p>
<p>My head began spinning. I wished this was all just a bad dream.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s all it was. A nightmare. A silly, weird nightmare waking
from which I would find my little family beside me. Whole and
complete.</p>
