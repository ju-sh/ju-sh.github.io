<hr />
<p>Laugh, and the world laughs with you;<br />
Weep, and you weep alone;<br />
For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,<br />
But has trouble enough of its own.<br />
Sing, and the hills will answer;<br />
Sigh, it is lost on the air;<br />
The echoes bound to a joyful sound,<br />
But shrink from voicing care.</p>
<p>Rejoice, and men will seek you;<br />
Grieve, and they turn and go;<br />
They want full measure of all your pleasure,<br />
But they do not need your woe.<br />
Be glad, and your friends are many;<br />
Be sad, and you lose them all;<br />
There are none to decline your nectar’d wine,<br />
But alone you must drink life’s gall.</p>
<p>Feast, and your halls are crowded;<br />
Fast, and the world goes by.<br />
Succeed and give, and it helps you live,<br />
But no man can help you die.<br />
There is room in the halls of pleasure<br />
For a large and lordly train,<br />
But one by one we must all file on<br />
Through the narrow aisles of pain.</p>
