<li>Poem by: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Zhi">Cao

</ul>
<p>Mentioned in <em>The romance of the three kingdoms</em> by Luo
Guanzhong.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Cao">Cao Cao</a> was the
effective leader of the state that would eventually become known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Wei">Cao Wei</a> during the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kingdoms">Three kingdoms</a>
period in China.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by his eldest son - <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Pi">Cao Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Cao Pi worried that his brothers would challenge his legitimacy as
ruler and summoned them to pay their respects to their new sovereign to
see if they posed any threat.</p>
<p>Soon it was the turn of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Zhi">Cao Zhi</a>, Cao Pi’s
younger brother. Cao Zhi was an accomplished poet. So Cao Pi said that
if Cao Zhi can compose a poem about a given topic within the time taken
to walk seven steps, he’ll let him go.</p>
<p>The topic given to Cao Zhi was ‘Brotherhood’. But he was not allowed
to use the word ‘brother’.</p>
<p>Cao Zhi successfully crafted a brilliant poem within these
constraints that impressed all who heard it - including the King, who
let him go free.</p>
<p>This came to be known as the ‘Seven step poem’ (七步诗).</p>
<p>The poem is prominently featured in the historical novel <em>The
romance of the three kingdoms</em> by Luo Guanzhong.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="poem">Poem</h2>
<p>As shown in the English subtitles of a video kindly translated by a
person or group people known as ‘Jiang Hu’:</p>
<pre><code>To boil beans, the stalks are burned;
In the kettle, they sobbing yearned:
We two from one same root did grow —
Why the haste to fry me so?</code></pre>
<p><code>---</code></p>
<p>Version from C. H. Brewitt Taylor’s translation (from <a
href="https://threekingdoms.com/079.htm">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code>They were boiling beans on a beanstalk fire;
Came a plaintive voice from the pot,
&#39;O why, since we sprang from the selfsame root,
Should you kill me with anger hot?&#39;</code></pre>
<p><code>---</code></p>
<p>Version from Robert Moss translation:</p>
<pre><code>Beans asimmer on a beanstalk flame 
From inside the pot expressed their ire:
&quot;Alive we sprouted on a single root —
What&#39;s your rush to cook us on the fire?&quot;</code></pre>
