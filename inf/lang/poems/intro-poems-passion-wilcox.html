<p>Oh, you who read some song that I have sung,<br />
What know you of the soul from whence it sprung?<br />
Dost dream the poet ever speaks aloud<br />
His secret thought unto the listening crowd?<br />
Go take the murmuring sea-shell from the shore:<br />
You have its shape, its color and no more.<br />
It tells not one of those vast mysteries<br />
That lie beneath the surface of the seas.<br />
Our songs are shells, cast out by-waves of thought;<br />
Here, take them at your pleasure; but think not<br />
Youâ€™ve seen beneath the surface of the waves,<br />
Where lie our shipwrecks and our coral caves.</p>
