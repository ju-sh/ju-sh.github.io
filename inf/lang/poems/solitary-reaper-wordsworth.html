<p>Behold her, single in the field,<br />
Yon solitary Highland Lass!<br />
Reaping and singing by herself;<br />
Stop here, or gently pass!<br />
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,<br />
And sings a melancholy strain;<br />
O listen! for the Vale profound<br />
Is overflowing with the sound.</p>
<p>No Nightingale did ever chaunt<br />
More welcome notes to weary bands<br />
Of travellers in some shady haunt,<br />
Among Arabian sands:<br />
A voice so thrilling ne’er was heard<br />
In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,<br />
Breaking the silence of the seas<br />
Among the farthest Hebrides.</p>
<p>Will no one tell me what she sings?—<br />
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br />
For old, unhappy, far-off things,<br />
And battles long ago:<br />
Or is it some more humble lay,<br />
Familiar matter of to-day?<br />
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,<br />
That has been, and may be again?</p>
<p>Whate’er the theme, the Maiden sang<br />
As if her song could have no ending;<br />
I saw her singing at her work,<br />
And o’er the sickle bending;—<br />
I listened, motionless and still;<br />
And, as I mounted up the hill,<br />
The music in my heart I bore,<br />
Long after it was heard no more.</p>
