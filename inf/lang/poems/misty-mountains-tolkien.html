<hr />
<p>Far over the misty mountains cold<br />
To dungeons deep and caverns old<br />
We must away ere break of day<br />
To seek the pale enchanted gold.</p>
<p>The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,<br />
While hammers fell like ringing bells<br />
In places deep, where dark things sleep,<br />
In hollow halls beneath the fells.</p>
<p>For ancient king and elvish lord<br />
There many a gleaming golden hoard<br />
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught<br />
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.</p>
<p>On silver necklaces they strung<br />
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung<br />
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire<br />
They meshed the light of moon and sun.</p>
<p>Far over the misty mountains cold<br />
To dungeons deep and caverns old<br />
We must away, ere break of day,<br />
To claim our long-forgotten gold.</p>
<p>Goblets they carved there for themselves<br />
And harps of gold; where no man delves<br />
There lay they long, and many a song<br />
Was sung unheard by men or elves.</p>
<p>The pines were roaring on the height,<br />
The winds were moaning in the night.<br />
The fire was red, it flaming spread;<br />
The trees like torches blazed with light.</p>
<p>The bells were ringing in the dale<br />
And men looked up with faces pale;<br />
The dragon’s ire more fierce than fire<br />
Laid low their towers and houses frail.</p>
<p>The mountain smoked beneath the moon;<br />
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.<br />
They fled their hall to dying fall<br />
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.</p>
<p>Far over the misty mountains grim<br />
To dungeons deep and caverns dim<br />
We must away, ere break of day,<br />
To win our harps and gold from him!</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Under the Mountain dark and tall<br />
The King has come unto his hall!<br />
His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,<br />
And ever so his foes shall fall.</p>
<p>The sword is sharp, the spear is long,<br />
The arrow swift, the Gate is strong;<br />
The heart is bold that looks on gold;<br />
The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.</p>
<p>The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,<br />
While hammers fell like ringing bells<br />
In places deep, where dark things sleep,<br />
In hollow halls beneath the fells.</p>
<p>On silver necklaces they strung<br />
The light of stars, on crowns they hung<br />
The dragon-fire, from twisted wire<br />
The melody of harps they wrung.</p>
<p>The mountain throne once more is freed!<br />
O! wandering folk, the summons heed!<br />
Come haste! Come haste! across the waste!<br />
The king of friend and kin has need.</p>
<p>Now call we over mountains cold,<br />
‘Come back unto the caverns old’!<br />
Here at the Gates the king awaits,<br />
His hands are rich with gems and gold.</p>
<p>The king is come unto his hall<br />
Under the Mountain dark and tall.<br />
The Worm of Dread is slain and dead,<br />
And ever so our foes shall fall!</p>
