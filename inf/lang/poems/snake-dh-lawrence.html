<hr />
<p>A snake came to my water-trough<br />
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,<br />
To drink there.</p>
<p>In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree<br />
I came down the steps with my pitcher<br />
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough
before me.</p>
<p>He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom<br />
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the edge
of the stone trough<br />
And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,<br />
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small
clearness,<br />
He sipped with his straight mouth,<br />
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,<br />
Silently.</p>
<p>Someone was before me at my water-trough,<br />
And I, like a second-comer, waiting.</p>
<p>He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,<br />
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,<br />
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a
moment,<br />
And stooped and drank a little more,<br />
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the
earth<br />
On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.</p>
<p>The voice of my education said to me<br />
He must be killed,<br />
For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are
venomous.</p>
<p>And voices in me said, If you were a man<br />
You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.</p>
<p>But must I confess how I liked him,<br />
How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my
water-trough<br />
And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,<br />
Into the burning bowels of this earth?</p>
<p>Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?<br />
Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?<br />
Was it humility, to feel honoured?<br />
I felt so honoured.</p>
<p>And yet those voices:<br />
If you were not afraid you would kill him.</p>
<p>And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,<br />
But even so, honoured still more<br />
That he should seek my hospitality<br />
From out the dark door of the secret earth.</p>
<p>He drank enough<br />
And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,<br />
And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,<br />
Seeming to lick his lips,<br />
And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,<br />
And slowly turned his head,<br />
And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,<br />
Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round<br />
And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.</p>
<p>And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,<br />
And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered
further,<br />
A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that
horrid black hole,<br />
Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself
after,<br />
Overcame me now his back was turned.</p>
<p>I looked round, I put down my pitcher,<br />
I picked up a clumsy log<br />
And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.</p>
<p>I think it did not hit him,<br />
But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in
undignified haste,<br />
Writhed like lightning, and was gone<br />
Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,<br />
At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.</p>
<p>And immediately I regretted it.<br />
I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!<br />
I despised myself and the voices of my accursèd human education.</p>
<p>And I thought of the albatross,<br />
And I wished he would come back, my snake.</p>
<p>For he seemed to me again like a king,<br />
Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,<br />
Now due to be crowned again.</p>
<p>And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords<br />
Of life.<br />
And I have something to expiate:<br />
A pettiness.</p>
