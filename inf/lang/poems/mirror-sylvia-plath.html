<hr />
<p>I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.<br />
Whatever I see I swallow immediately<br />
Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.<br />
I am not cruel, only truthful â€š<br />
The eye of a little god, four-cornered.<br />
Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.<br />
It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long<br />
I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.<br />
Faces and darkness separate us over and over.</p>
<p>Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,<br />
Searching my reaches for what she really is.<br />
Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.<br />
I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.<br />
She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.<br />
I am important to her. She comes and goes.<br />
Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.<br />
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman<br />
Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.</p>
