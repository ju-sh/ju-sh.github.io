<h2 id="outline"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Outline</h2>
<p>Jonas lives with this father, mother and younger sister in a rural
area of Algeria.</p>
<p>Zahra is verbally challenged and can neither speak or hear.</p>
<p>Issa, Jonas's father, is a farmer who is expecting a plentiful
harvest from his fields soon and is happy that he would able to pay off
his debts for which he mortgaged his ancestral lands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a fire breaks out in his field one night and destroys
all of his crops. The family is forced out of their home.</p>
<p>Issa decides to travel to the city - Oran, in search of a new
life.</p>
<p>Jonas is forced to abondon his dog as the dog won't be able to join
them.</p>
<p>When the family reaches Oran, Issa meets his elder brother Mahieddine
(aka Mahi) and explains his situation.</p>
<p>Mahi arranges a living space for the family via a broker named Bliss
in a slum named Jenane Jato.</p>
<p>The family is not familiar with city life and struggles to cope with
it. Issa even ends up leaving Jonas in an unsafe neighbourhood once.</p>
<p>Issa sends off Jonas to live with Mahieddine when Issa ends up
killing a thug (nicknamed El Moro) who stole a lot of his money.</p>
<p>Mahi and his wife Germaine adopts him. Germaine is of French descent.
A Catholic married to the Muslim Mahi.</p>
<p>The film had led me to believe their families disowned them for the
inter-religious marriage due to the conservative nature of society at
the time. Turns out that Mahi's father actually agreed to it. Not sure
about Germaine's family though.</p>
<p>Issa turns to alcoholism afterwards and goes missing. Jonas has no
contact with his biological mother for years afterwards, and Germaine
and Mahieddine becomes his parents in almost every way.</p>
<p>Jonas would attempt to find to find his mother and sister, years
afterwards, but by then it is too late as they had moved to somewhere
else.</p>
<p>Jonas would never see his mother and sister again.</p>
<p>Thus he loses all connection to his immediate biological family
before coming off age.</p>
<p>Jonas befriends his neighbour Lucette, who is of the same age. He is
surprised to know that Jérôme, Lucette's father, is an atheist.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mahi had been involved in Algerian nationalist movements
(even having once hosted Messali Hadj in his home for dinner once) and
gets the attention of the police. Mahi spends a week in police custody
and is devastated upon his release. He fears that his friends would
isolate him thinking that he spilled the beans on them and decides to
leave Oran for Rio Salado, which is around 60km away.</p>
<p>Jonas and Lucette are sad to part, but seem to accepts that there is
nothing that they can do about it.</p>
<p>So the family moves from the city to a quiter country side. Having
lived outside the city before joining Mahi, Jonas likes Rio Salado.</p>
<p>Mahi sets up a pharmacy with Germaine, where he first meets Émilie.
Jonas notices her 'coal-black eyes'. Eyes dark as the night.</p>
<p>Jonas becomes friends with Isabelle. Isabelle considers Jonas her
'fiancée' but comes to see him in a different light when she realizes
that he is of Arab ancestry.</p>
<p>This would be Jonas's first encounter with racism. Though Isabelle is
still a child, she is prejudiced against Arabs.</p>
<p>Jean-Christophe beats Jonas up at school in a bid to impress
Isabelle. Jonas refuses to say who did it to both the teacher and
Germaine.</p>
<p>Under pressure from Isabelle and probably out of gratitude for not
ratting him out, Jean-Christophe apologizes and Jonas becomes part of
their gang. A friendship that would run throught out their lives.</p>
<p>Fabrice, 3 months younger to Jonas, was an aspring writer who liked
to read books and write poems. His mother was a rich widow who had
business interests in Oran and Rio Salado. She was the only in town who
drove a vehicle.</p>
<p>Simon, who lived closest to Jonas's house, was his best friend.
Described as the life of every party. His father was financially not
well-off.</p>
<p>Jean-Christophe was the son of a caretaker. Being Isabelle's
boyfriend, he has a hard time.</p>
<p>Part of the extended gang were the Sosa cousins: André and José.</p>
<p>WWII is going on. France surrendered to Nazi Germany. British forces
bomb the French naval base in Oran as part of Operation Catapult. An
event seen by many among France as an act of backstabbing by an
ally.</p>
<p>Jonas gets a glimpse of Oran after this raid when he goes with
Germaine to attend the funeral of one her nephews who died in it.</p>
<p>While in Oran, Jonas goes back Jenane Jeto to meet his mother, not
knowing that it would be the last time he would ever see her.</p>
<p>Rio Salado hears of the Allied forces landing in Oran as part of
Operation Torch. American soldiers go around Oran like tourists and Dedé
befriends some of them.</p>
<p>Jonas is shocked to find that one of his old neighbours has ended up
in a brothel. This makes him want to visit Jenane Jato again to see how
his mother and sister are faring. But much to his despair, he finds that
they had left years ago.</p>
<p>Later on while on an excursion to the beach with his friends, Jonas
happens to meet Madame Cazenave, who lived close to Rio Salado.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Germaine assigns Jonas to deliver an order that Madame
Cazanave had placed at the pharmacy, who being eager to see Cazanave
again, happily accepts it. But upon reaching the Cazanaves' house,
Madame Cazanave ends up seducing Jonas. For Cazanave it was casual, but
Jonas becomes infatuated with her for a while. He attempts to meet her
again but is brought back to his senses when she makes it plain that she
didn't want a relationship with Jonas.</p>
<p>The Second World War, which had been going on, ended. But around the
same time protests demanding Algerian independence were violently
suppressed and incidents like the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harki">Sétif massacre</a> occurred
(in Constantine, Algeria).</p>
<p>Mahi, who had a deep interest in Algerian nationalism, has a heart
attack leading to hospitalization around this time.</p>
<p>André's had an employee named Jelloul, whom he treated very poorly
due in most part to Arab ancestry. Jonas helps him when André throws him
out after a lot of beatings and without pay.</p>
<p>When Jonas asks if got another job lined up, Jelloul smiles
mysteriously. It is revealed later that Jelloul joins the LNF. The way
André treated Jelloul influenced his decision.</p>
<p>Yet Jelloul ends up doing similar things during his militant life,
leading Jonas to ask him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>N'est-ce pas l'humiliation qui t'a contraint à porter les armes ?
Pourquoi l'exerces-tu à ton tour, aujourd'hui ?</em></p>
<p>Wasn't it the humiliation that forced you to take arms? Why are you
doing that in your turn today?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jellould had no reply.</p>
<p>Jelloul was hurt and could hardly walk when he turned up at Jonas's
place. So Jonas drops him off on his bicycle. Jonas is shocked to see
the condition in which Jelloul's family lived.</p>
<p>Jonas says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Je pensais avoir touché le fond de la misère, à Jenane Jato ; je
me trompais. La misère du douar où habitait Jelloul et sa famille
dépassait les bornes.</em></p>
<p>I thought I had touched the bottom of poverty at Jenane Jato; I was
mistaken. The poverty of the douar where Jelloul and his family lived
surpassed that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I suppose douar is a kind of slum.)</p>
<p>Turns out that the native Arabs live away from the town in Rio
Salado. Jonas is afraid when he remembers that he is on the 'other
side'. And that if anything happened to him, noone is going to look for
him there. Thus indicating that the town-folk didn't care about the
poorer people like Jelloul.</p>
<p>Jonas saw pot-bellied children at Jelloul's neighbourhood. <a
href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/kwashiorkor/">Kwashiorkor</a>. A
sign of severe malnutrision.</p>
<p>The settlers brought development to Algeria, but they trampled on
those who were there before them.</p>
<p>If the way André treats Jelloul is anything to go by, the colons
treated the native Arabs like sub-humans.</p>
<p>It seems that many in the European part of the town didn't even know
about the conditions in which people like Jelloul lived. Jonas was
surprised at the poverty he saw.</p>
<p>As Jelloul said, Jonas was in a different situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tu ne peux pas comprendre, toi. Tu es des nôtres, mais tu mènes
leur vie…</em></p>
<p>You can't understand… You're one of us, but you lead their life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Algerian war was beginning, but Jonas and his friends didn't
bother to pay it much attention as it doesn't disturb their life..
yet.</p>
<p>After the heart attack, Mahi couldn't be the man he used to be. He
slowly began to appear to be losing his mind.</p>
<p>Sometime after the end of the Second World War, André opens an
American style bar in the outskirts of Rio Salado and has a grand
opening.</p>
<p>The entire gang is captivated by a girl who comes to attend the
opening of the bar.</p>
<p>She was Madame Cazanave's daughter, Émilie. She quickly becomes
Fabrice's girlfriend. Jonas doesn't realize at this point that this is
the same Émilie that he used to know in his childhood.</p>
<p>But Émilie remembers Jonas and at a picnic that Fabrice was having,
she realizes that Jonas was the boy that she used to meet at the
pharmacy in her childhood. Jonas, aware that Émilie is taking an
interest in him and fearful of hurting his friend Fabrice, avoids
Émilie, who realizes it and stops attempting to visit Jonas at the
pharmacy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Madame Cazanave figures out that her daughter thinks a lot
about Jonas and make him swear that he won't encourage Émilie to pursue
him. This oath is a central point in the story. This oath is one of the
things that prevents Jonas from doing what he would have liked to
do.</p>
<p>Still, Jonas holds to true to his oath and avoids Émilie.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Émilie unceremoniously ditches Fabrice for Jean-Christophe,
who in turn breaks up with Isabelle, breaking both Fabrice's and
Isabelle's hearts and causing Simon to profess a disliking for
Émilie.</p>
<p>Émilie finally gets a chance to express herself to Jonas when Mahi
sends him to buy a book from the local bookshop just when Émilie was
substituting for usual storekeeper (Madame Lambert). But Jean-Christophe
see them together and blames Jonas for betraying him.</p>
<p>Mad with grief, Jean-Christophe leaves Rio Salado and no one has any
news of him for days.</p>
<p>Émilie visits Jonas in his pharmacy to apologize for this turn of
events and continues the conversation that they were having at the
bookshop before Jean-Christophe showed up. Émilie makes it clear that
she loves Jonas and reminds him of their first meeting in their
childhood in vivid detail.</p>
<p>Jonas's behaviour leads Émilie to think that he is not being
considerate to her because of the way she treated Jean-Christophe and
waits for Jonas. She finds silly excuses to visit Jonas in the pharmacy
who pretends not to notice her pain.</p>
<p>After a while Émilie stops trying to contact Jonas and asks him to
see her if he likes, but Jonas never does.</p>
<p>Later on, Madame Cazenave induces Émilie into marrying Simon. In a
last ditch effort, Émilie pays Jonas a discreet visit to request him one
last time to accept her love. But Jonas is indecisive and doesn't speak
a single word, leading Émilie to leave in despair.</p>
<p>The next morning Émilie sends him back the rose flower that Jonas had
pressed into her book in their childhood. Turns out that she valued it
that much. This should have made Jonas to make an attempt to put
Émilie's mind at ease but he doesn't.</p>
<p>Jonas avoids attending the engagement but can't find a way to safely
skip the marriage.</p>
<p>After the marriage, Jonas falls into a period of depression. He flees
to Oran and tries to retrace his childhood there. He tries in vain to
find Lucette. Finally it takes a prostitute to tell him some sense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>« Ressaisis-toi, bonhomme. Il n'y a qu'un seul dieu sur terre, et
c'est toi. Si le monde ne te convient pas, réinventes-en un autre, et ne
laisse aucun chagrin te faire descendre de ton nuage. La vie sourit
toujours à celui qui sait lui rendre la monnaie de sa pièce. »</p>
<p>Pull yourselves together, chap.. There's only one god here on earth,
and that's you. If you don't like the world, make one you like better.
Fortune smiles on those who smile on her.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Jonas returns to Rio Salado.</p>
<p>A baby boy is born to Simon and Émilie. They name him Michel.</p>
<p>Mahi, who had shown signs of being reclusive again after recovering
from his heart attack, dies. Five months later, Algerian war formally
begins.</p>
<p>At first, Rio Salado is not much affected by the war. But then José
gets murdered right outside André's diner.</p>
<p>André in his grief, picks on Jelloul and accuses him of being
involved in the murder due to his Arab ancestry. The police arrests
Jelloul.</p>
<p>Jelloul's mother pleads to Jonas to save Jelloul and Jonas attempts
to talk to Pépé Rucillio about it wihout success.</p>
<p>Jean-Christophe returns home, after having joined the army and served
in the French-Indochina. But Jonas is hurt as he was not invited to the
reunion held afterwards.</p>
<p>Jean-Christophe still hadn't forgiven Jonas.</p>
<p>Jonas didn't even know about Jean-Christophe's marriage to Isabelle
till it was over.</p>
<p>Jonas comes face to face with the consequences of the ongoing war of
the first time when he witnesses a drive-by right that leaves many
people dead.</p>
<p>Then one night, a group of people set fire to the Cazanave mansion
and kills Simon. Jonas rushes to the place upon seeing the glow of the
fire and is devastated to find Simon's body lying on the ground with his
throat cut. Émilie forbids Jonas from touching Simon and yells at him
get out of her sight.</p>
<p>Émilie leaves Rio Salado with Michel after Simon's funeral.</p>
<p>Jonas makes attempts to find Émilie in Oran every now and then and
finally finds her working in a bookshop.</p>
<p>After a few days' hesitancy, Jonas tries to meet Émilie who treats
him coldly and wouldn't accept his apologies that were too late.</p>
<p>Jonas doesn't make another attempt to talk to her. Possibly in part
due to him becoming complicit in the ongoing civil war. Turns out that
Jelloul has joined the rebels. He brings one of his wounded leaders and
forces Jonas and Germaine to treat him.</p>
<p>Jonas continues to help Jelloul by clandestinely providing his
friends with medicinal supplies. But Krimo, who had become a harki,
finds out about this and turns him over to the military.</p>
<p>However, Pépé urged on by Isabelle, pleads on Jonas's behalf and gets
him out.</p>
<p>Jonas is surprised that Isabelle helped him despite being in Oran.
This leads to a conversation between him and Germaine after which Jonas
realizes that she and him have become so distant that Germaine, who had
been everything to him, now considered him barely more than a
stranger.</p>
<p>Opposition of people who didn't like the idea of Algeria becoming
independent manifested in the form of events like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War#Week_of_barricades">the
week of barricades</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers_putsch_of_1961">the failed
coup of 1961</a>. Despite the reigning chaos, Jonas desperately attempts
to find Émilie, but in vain.</p>
<p>The victorious FLN finally marches into Rio Salado and Jelloul repays
Jonas's kindness by freeing Jean-Christophe, who had become an active
OAS member.</p>
<p>Later on, Dédé finds out that Émilie is in Marseilles, having left
Algeria during the exodus that happened around the end of the civil
war.</p>
<p>Jonas travels to France and meets her. She seemed to be indifferent,
yet becomes soft towards the end of their meeting and tells Jonas that
it's no one's fault that things turned out the way they did and that he
doesn't owe her anything.</p>
<p>This would be the last time Jonas sees Émilie.</p>
<p>Jonas, disappointed, returns to Algeria.</p>
<p>He wrote her letters, but she never replies.</p>
<p>Time passes and Jonas marries and becomes a father and then a
grandfather.</p>
<p>Then he receives news of Émilie's death and decides to visit her tomb
in France.</p>
<p>Michel, Simon and Émilie's son, receives Jonas at the airport and
they visit Émilie's grave. They have a reunion with many familiar faces.
Dédé, Krimo, and Fabrice among them. But Jean-Chrisophe doesn't turn up.
Jonas can't help thinking that it's because he's still angry with
him.</p>
<p>Michel gives Jonas a box that Émilie had assigned him to deliver to
Jonas. Jonas first can't bring himself to open it, but when he does he
discovers the letters that he had sent to Émilie. All unopened.</p>
<p>One of the letters was not of Jonas and he opens it. It is a note
from Émilie that she wrote only a week before her death saying that she
hoped to see Jonas again after their last meeting. She forgives him for
tormenting her and asks Jonas to do the same to her. Émilie promises
that she will always have a thought for Jonas in the afterlife.</p>
<p>This calms Jonas. Maybe it was the realization that Émilie finally
did forgive him.</p>
<p>Jonas prepares to board his flight back to Algeria when
Jean-Chrisophe finally makes his appearance. They have a friendly
reunion.</p>
<p>Jonas looks back one last time before boarding his flight and
imagines all his friends, both living and dead, waving to him.</p>
<p>A nice ending, though with a touch of sadness.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="operation-catapult">Operation Catapult</h3>
<p>British attack on ships at the French-Algerian navel base in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir">Mers
el-Kébir</a>.</p>
<p>Hadn't known about this event. Was quite surprised. Britain and
French were on the same side after all. Over 1000 (<em>mille
quatre-vingt-dix-sept</em>) French servicemen were killed. What to say..
Horrors of war…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notre premier été à Río Salado débuta mal. Le 3 juillet 1940, le pays
fut ébranlé par l'opération Catapult qui vit l'escadre britannique «
Force H » bombarder les vaisseaux de guerre français amarrés en rade à
la base navale de Mers el-Kébir. Trois jours après, ne nous laissant
même pas le temps de mesurer l'ampleur de la catastrophe, les avions de
Sa Majesté revinrent achever leur travail de sape.</p>
<p>Le neveu de Germaine, cuistot sur le cuirassé Dunkerque, figurait
parmi les mille deux cent quatre-vingt-dix-sept marins tués lors de ces
raids. Mon oncle, sombrant progressivement dans une sorte d'autisme
chronique, refusa de nous accompagner aux funérailles, et nous dûmes
partir sans lui, Germaine et moi.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-author">About the author</h2>
<p>An Algerian born novelist who writes in French. Yasmina Khadra
(ياسمينة خضراء), which means 'green jasmine blossom' <a
href="https://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/636783/culture/dix-choses-a-savoir-sur-yasmina-khadra-lecrivain-algerien-le-plus-celebre-de-sa-generation/">¹²</a>,
is his pen-name (<em>nom de plume</em>). Real name is Mohammed
Moulessehoul (محمد مولسهول). The pen-name was inspired by the name of
his wife.</p>
<p>He once served in the Algerian army and may have drawn from his
experiences from that time while writing his novels, including this
one.</p>
<p>I found out after reading the book that this title is considered the
last novel in what is known as the 'Algerian trilogy' of novels by the
author.</p>
<h2 id="discrimination"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span>
Discrimination</h2>
<p>Those with European-ancestry in French Algeria looked down on the
native populace. A fact made totally evident when Jonas sees the place
where Jelloul lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought that I had seen poverty in Jenane Jato; I was wrong. The
shanty town where Jelloul and his family lived was beyond anything I had
ever imagined. The douar was made up of a dozen squalid hovels on the
banks of a dried-up riverbed. A few scrawny goats ambled around. The
place smelled so foul I found it difficult to imagine how anyone could
spend two days here. When the path petered out, I left the bike on the
slopes and helped Jelloul down the hill. The marabout's hill was only a
few kilometres from Río Salado, but I could not remember ever having
passed this way. People shunned the place, as though it were cursed.
Suddenly the simple fact that I was on the far side of the hill
terrified me. I was scared something might happen to me, and I knew that
if anything did, no one would think to come looking for me here. It was
ridiculous, but the fear was all too real. I felt a mortal dread at
being in this douar of ramshackle huts pervaded by the stench of rotting
flesh.</p>
<p><em>Je pensais avoir touché le fond de la misère, à Jenane Jato ; je
me trompais. La misère du douar où habitait Jelloul et sa famille
dépassait les bornes. Le hameau comptait une dizaine de gourbis
sordides, au creux d'une rivière morte cernée d'enclos où quelques
chèvres squelettiques se morfondaient. L'endroit sentait si mauvais que
je n'arrivais pas à croire que des gens puissent y survivre deux jours
d'affilée. Incapable de m'aventurer plus loin, je rangeai ma bicyclette
sur le bas-côté de la piste et aidai le factotum à mettre pied à terre.
La colline aux deux marabouts ne se trouvait qu'à quelques encablures de
Río Salado ; pourtant, je ne me souvenais pas d'avoir poussé la
randonnée jusque dans les parages. Les gens évitaient de se hasarder par
ici. Comme s'il s'agissait d'un territoire maudit. Soudain j'eus peur
d'être là, de l'autre côté de la colline ; peur de ne pas m'en sortir
indemne, certain que si un accident m'arrivait, personne ne viendrait me
chercher là où je n'avais aucune raison de m'aventurer. C'était absurde,
mais la crainte était forte, bien réelle. Le hameau, subitement,
m'épouvantait. Et cette odeur infernale, si proche de celle des
décompositions!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of naked children were playing in the dust, their bellies
swollen, flies crawling on their faces. Then I realised that it was not
simply the stench; it was the drone of the flies, incessant, voracious,
filling the foul air like some baleful supplication, like the breath of
some demon that lowered over human misery, a sound as old as time
itself. At the foot of a low toube wall, a group of old men lay dozing,
mouths open, huddled beside a sleeping donkey. A madman, arms raised to
the heavens, stood babbling wildly beneath a marabout tree from which
hung talismans, coloured ribbons and candle wax. There was no one else:
it was as though the douar had been abandoned to feral children and
dying men.</p>
<p><em>Des gamins nus jouaient dans la poussière, le ventre ballonné et
les narines assiégées de mouches – oui, c'était ça ; en plus de la
puanteur, il y avait le bourdonnement des mouches, vorace, obsessionnel
; il n'arrêtait pas d'engrosser l'air vicié d'une litanie funeste, comme
un souffle diabolique planant par-dessus une détresse humaine aussi
vieille que le monde et tout aussi affligeante. Au pied d'un muret en
toube, à proximité d'une bourrique assoupie, un groupe de vieillards
somnolait, la bouche ouverte. Les bras décharnés levés au ciel, un fou
s'adressait à un arbre-marabout bigarré de rubans talismaniques et de
coulées de cierges… Puis, plus rien ; on aurait dit le hameau déserté
par les personnes valides et livré aux mioches faunesques et aux
moribonds.</em></p>
<p>A pack of dogs ran towards me, growling. Jelloul picked up a stone
and drove them off. There was silence again. He turned and gave me a
strange smile.</p>
<p><em>Une bande de chiens nous repéra et fonça sur moi en aboyant.
Jelloul la repoussa à coups de pierres. Une fois le silence rétabli, il
se retourna vers moi et m'adressa un sourire étrange.</em></p>
<p>‘This is how our people live, Jonas; my people and your people too.
Here, nothing ever changes, while you go on living like a prince . . .
What's the matter? Why don't you say something? You're shocked; you
can't believe it, can you? Maybe now you know why I call myself a dog.
Even a dog would not live like this.'</p>
<p>— <em>C'est comme ça que vivent les nôtres, Jonas. Les nôtres qui
sont aussi les tiens. Sauf qu'ils n'évoluent pas là où tu te la coules
douce… Qu'est-ce que tu as ? Pourquoi ne dis-tu rien ? Tu es choqué ? Tu
n'en reviens pas, n'est-ce pas ?… J'espère que tu me comprends
maintenant quand je te parle de chien. Même les bêtes n'accepteraient
pas de tomber si bas.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonas, and probably the 'European part' of Rio Salado didn't even
know that people like Jelloul whom they see everyday were living in such
conditions.</p>
<p>Dédé, for instance, considers Arabs beneath him.</p>
<h3 id="blue-eyes">Blue eyes</h3>
<p>Jonas, his father and Mahi had blue eyes.</p>
<p>Peg-Leg at Jenane Jato wonders if Jonas had a French ancestor due to
had blue eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Comment ça s'fait que t'as les yeux bleus? Ta mère est
française?</em></p>
<p>How come you got blue eyes? Is your mother French?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isabelle tells Jonas his eyes being blue isn't enough when she
realizes that he is of Arab descent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nous ne sommes pas du même monde, monsieur Younes. Et le bleu de
tes yeux ne suffit pas.</em></p>
<p>We are not from the same world, monsieur Younes. And the blue of your
eyes is not enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isabelle had been Jonas' friend till she found out that his birth
name was Younes. She had even gone far as to declare him her 'fiancée'
in one of her childish whims.</p>
<p>When Isabelle confronts him, Jonas is at first confused. Even when
she makes it clear that it's because of his name was Younes. Jonas can't
understand what difference that would make.</p>
<p>To which Isabelle says 'everything' and that she would never marry an
Arab.</p>
<p>This would be his first taste of the discrimination that prevailed in
Algeria at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>— Menteur ! Je compris, à la sécheresse de son ton et à
l'incandescence de son regard, qu'elle m'en voulait à mort. Isabelle
usait toujours de ce ton et de ce regard quand elle s'apprêtait à
déployer ses inimitiés. Ignorant ce qu'elle me reprochait et ne
m'attendant pas à être accueilli à froid de cette façon, je restai sans
voix. — Je ne veux plus te revoir, lâcha-t-elle sentencieusement.
C'était la première fois que je l'entendais tutoyer quelqu'un. —
Pourquoi ?… s'écria-t-elle, horripilée par ma perplexité. Pourquoi
m'as-tu menti ?… — Je ne vous ai jamais menti. — Ah oui ?… Ton nom est
Younes, n'est-ce pas ? You-nes ?… Alors pourquoi tu te fais appeler
Jonas ? — Tout le monde m'appelle Jonas… Qu'est-ce que ça change ? —
Tout ! hurla-t-elle en manquant de s'étouffer. Son visage congestionné
frétillait de dépit : — Ça change tout !… Après avoir repris son
souffle, elle me dit, sans appel : — Nous ne sommes pas du même monde,
monsieur Younes. Et le bleu de tes yeux ne suffit pas. Avant de me
claquer les volets de la fenêtre au nez, elle émit un hoquet de mépris
et ajouta : — Je suis une Rucillio, as-tu oublié ?… Tu m'imagines mariée
à un Arabe ?… Plutôt crever !</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="lazy-people">Lazy people</h3>
<p>Once Jonas hears someone at school saying that Arabs are lazy. This
upsets him enough for him to ask Mahi about it.</p>
<p>Mahi says that the French considers Arabs lazy because the latter
prefers to enjoy life in a manner different from that of the
Europeans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>De retour à la maison, j'étais allé directement trouver mon oncle
dans son bureau. — C'est vrai que les Arabes sont paresseux ? Mon oncle
était surpris par l'agressivité de mon ton. Il avait reposé le livre
qu'il était en train de parcourir et s'était retourné vers moi. Ce qu'il
avait lu sur ma figure l'avait attendri. — Viens un peu par ici, mon
garçon, m'avait-il dit en m'ouvrant ses bras. — Non… Je veux savoir si
c'est vrai. Est-ce que les Arabes sont des paresseux ? Mon oncle s'était
pris le menton entre le pouce et l'index en me dévisageant. L'heure
était grave ; il me devait des explications. Après avoir réfléchi, il
s'était mis en face de moi et m'avait dit : — Nous ne sommes pas
paresseux. Nous prenons seulement le temps de vivre. Ce qui n'est pas le
cas des Occidentaux. Pour eux, le temps, c'est de l'argent. Pour nous,
le temps, ça n'a pas de prix. Un verre de thé suffit à notre bonheur,
alors qu'aucun bonheur ne leur suffit. Toute la différence est là, mon
garçon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose '<em>le temps, ça n'a pas de prix</em>' means means that
time is priceless, not that it has no price. Because after all, time is
the most valuable thing known to man kind.</p>
<h2 id="last-letter">Last letter</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>« Cher Younes,</p>
<p>Je t'ai attendu le lendemain de notre rencontre à Marseille. Au même
endroit. Je t'ai attendu le jour d'après, et les jours qui ont suivi. Tu
n'es pas revenu. Le mektoub, comme on dit chez nous. Un rien suffit à
tout, à ce qui est bon et à ce qui ne l'est pas. Il faut savoir
accepter. Avec le temps, on s'assagit. Je regrette tous les reproches
que je t'ai faits. C'est peut-être pour ça que je n'ai pas osé ouvrir
tes lettres. Il est des silences qu'il ne faut pas déranger. Pareils à
l'eau dormante, ils apaisent notre âme.</p>
<p>Pardonne-moi comme je t'ai pardonné.</p>
<p>De là où je suis maintenant, auprès de Simon et de mes chers
disparus, j'aurai toujours une pensée pour toi.</p>
<p>Émilie. »</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, my attempt at translating this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Younès,</p>
<p>I waited for you the day after our encounter at Marseille. At the
same place. I waited for you the day after that, and the days following
that. You didn't come back. Mektoub, as we say in our home. Nothing is
enough for everything, for that is good and for what is not good. You
have to learn to accept it. With time, we calm down. I'm sorry for
everything that I blamed you for. Maybe it's because of this that I
didn't dare open your letters. There are silences that necessarily
shouldn't be disturbed. Like the still water, it soothes our soul.</p>
<p>Forgive me as I have forgiven you.</p>
<p>From where I am now, with Simon and my dear ones that have departed,
I will always have a thought for you.</p>
<p>Émilie</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mektoub (مكتوب) means fate. It literally means 'what has been
written'.</p>
<p>(Was a little confused to see that 'un rien' meant 'a little'.)</p>
<p>Now the proper translation from the English version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Younes,</p>
<p>I waited for you the day after our meeting in Marseille. Waited in
the same spot. I waited for you the next day and all the days that
followed, but you never came back. Fate – mektoub, as we say in our
country. A tiny detail can change everything, for better or for worse.
We learn to accept it. In time we become calmer, wiser. I regret all the
terrible things I said to you. Perhaps that is why I never dared open
your letters. There are silences that should not be broken. Like still
waters, they restore our soul.</p>
<p>Forgive me as I have forgiven you.</p>
<p>Here, where I am now, with Simon and all those I loved and lost, I
will always think of you.</p>
<p>Émilie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Émilie did want to see Jonas again. Why didn't she reach out to
him then? She knew that he would have come rushing to her. Why did she
choose not to open his letters. Émilie later assigns her son Michel to
give Jonas those letters. Some of them were crumpled and then soothened
out. As if Émilie first wanted to get rid of it and then thought better
of it.</p>
<p>Was it anger that caused her to crumple up some of the letters? Or is
it regret at having said terrible things to Jonas?</p>
<p>Why did Jonas seek out Émilie after Simon's death? Was it really to
be with her? Did Jonas think that it was possible for her to marry her?
That's what the film suggests. The book is less clear about that.</p>
<p>I suppose Émilie feels her devotion to Simon to be an obstacle. Not
to mention the mental agony that Jonas caused her over the years that
she had spent waiting for him fruitlessly.</p>
<p>And her last letter to Jonas. It was dated one week before her death.
So she felt her end nearing (unless the letter was forged by Michel or
someone to let Jonas feel better.) I suppose Émilie wanted to make up to
Jonas towards the end.</p>
<p>The agony that she put Jonas through can only be compared to what
Jonas put her through. Sort of like tit for tat. Though probably not
pre-meditated. It just happened.</p>
<p>In the letter Émilie speaks as if she is already in heaven: 'De là où
je suis maintenant, auprès de Simon et de mes chers disparus'. She sees
her back with Simon and those that have passed away.</p>
<p>She promises Jonas that she will always have a thought for him in the
afterlife.</p>
<h2 id="le-guerre"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Le guerre</h2>
<p>The civil war happened in Algeria. How did the FLN get the weapons?
Who sold them weapons? I suppose there are people who wants profit by
any means in any war. Such people won't flinch away from actually
bringing about wars for their own benefit.</p>
<p>The colonials gave education in some ways. They needed educated
people to help them. But the education helped them start to think about
their condition and they figured out that they were being exploited.
Second-class citizens in their own land.</p>
<p>But how is land ownership decided anyway? Is it not just by might?
See the case of red indians of America. What's their status now?</p>
<p>The colonials were people who had the land and lived a royal life.
Although it can't be denied that they made better use of the land as far
as profitability is concerned.</p>
<p>The disparity in living conditions and income would have incited
jealousy, resentment and a host of negative emotions among the less
privileged. Especially when they see that the natives are poor while the
foreigners are rich.</p>
<h2 id="simon">Simon</h2>
<p>He knew that it was Jonas who Émilie loved all along but chose to
accept it. I think Émilie came to realize that Simon loved her
selflessly.</p>
<h2 id="enemies-and-friends">Enemies and friends</h2>
<p>Almost overnight, friends became enemies.</p>
<p>La guerre.</p>
<h2 id="the-gang"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> The gang</h2>
<p>Jonas and his friends were as 'inseperable as the tines of a
fork'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On nous appelait les doigts de la fourche. Nous étions
inséparables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still they drifted apart over time. I suppose that's life.</p>
<p>The gang primarily consisted of Jean-Christophe, Fabrice, Simon and
Jonas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Il y avait Jean-Christophe Lamy, seize ans et déjà un géant. Parce
qu'il était l'aîné, il était le chef. Blond comme une botte de foin, un
sourire d'éternel prétendant sur les lèvres ; la plupart des filles de
Río Salado fantasmaient sur lui. Mais depuis qu'Isabelle Rucillio avait
consenti à le prendre provisoirement pour « fiancé », il se tenait à
carreau. Il y avait Fabrice Scamaroni, de deux mois mon cadet, un garçon
sublime, le cœur sur la main et la tête dans les nuages ; il
ambitionnait de devenir romancier. Sa mère, une jeune veuve un peu
déjantée, possédait des boutiques à Rio et à Oran. Elle menait sa vie
comme elle l'entendait et était la seule femme de la région à conduire
une voiture. Les mauvaises langues salivaient à son sujet à se
déshydrater ; Mme Scamaroni s'en moquait. Elle était belle. Riche.
Indépendante. Que demander de plus ?… L'été, elle nous bousculait tous
les quatre sur la banquette arrière de sa robuste traction avant six
cylindres de quinze chevaux et nous emmenait à Terga- plage. Après la
baignade, elle improvisait un barbecue et nous gavait d'olives noires,
de brochettes d'agneau et de sardines grillées sur la braise. Puis il y
avait Simon Benyamin, Juif autochtone, quinze ans comme moi ; court sur
pattes, bedonnant, voire rondouillard, et des coups tordus à en
revendre. C'était un joyeux drille, un peu désabusé à cause de ses
revers affectifs, mais attachant quand il voulait bien s'en donner la
peine. Il rêvait de faire carrière dans le théâtre ou le cinéma. À Rio,
sa famille n'avait pas la cote. Son père portait la scoumoune ; il ne
montait une affaire que pour se casser les dents dessus, si bien qu'il
devait de l'argent à tout le monde, y compris aux saisonniers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonas gained the trust of the gang and became of a part of it by
refusing to tell on Jean-Christophe who beat him up in a bid to impress
Isabelle. Even when Jonas got punished for refusing to reveal the one
who beat him up. Jean-Christophe's action did not have the effect that
he desired on Isabelle, however, who made him apologize ot Jonas.</p>
<h3 id="likelihood-of-the-friendship">Likelihood of the friendship</h3>
<p>I'm not sure how likely it would've been for a group of French
youngsters to accept someone of Arab descent into their gang due to the
prejudices that prevailed then.</p>
<p>See how Dédé treats his Arab employee.</p>
<p>How Isabelle treated Jonas at first when she realized that he was of
Arab descent.</p>
<p>Even then it's very difficult to imagine that Jean-Christophe chose
not to make heavy use of Jonas's Arab ancestry to insult him when the
former found Jonas with Émilie.</p>
<p>And did Isabelle dramatically change her prejudices? I don't think
so.</p>
<p>The fault lines would've been there. And the war would certainly
would've reopened old wounds in real life.</p>
<p>People would look for something to blame with and ancestry is
something that comes up quite easily.</p>
<p>That didn't happen in the story depicted. If only that happened in
real life as well…</p>
<h2 id="why-only-jonas"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Why only
Jonas</h2>
<p>Why did Jonas's family gave just him to the pharmacist uncle? What
about his sister? Why wasn't she given? Because she was too young?</p>
<p>Because there was only one slot and a boy was considered a better
investment than a girl?</p>
<p>Why did the mother drive him out saying that there was nothing for
him in their house? Was Jonas particularly good at studies?</p>
<p>Is that why he was chosen to be with the uncle?</p>
<h2 id="jonas-and-émilie">Jonas and Émilie</h2>
<h2 id="letting-go"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Letting go</h2>
<p>Both Jonas and Émilie are having a hard time letting go. Both the
past and people.</p>
<p>Jonas took longer than Émilie to let go of a possible love that
looked unlikely to ever materialize. Émilie tried to wait, and even made
a desperate last attempt to get at least a word from Jonas, and then
resigned herself to fate. Whereas Jonas sort of tried to wreck himself
in his grief.</p>
<p>Reminds me of a few quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't chase people. Be yourself, do your own thing and work hard. The
right people will come to you and stay. ⁴¹</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you just need to distance yourself from people. If they
care, they'll notice. If they don't, you know where you stand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though Jonas feels that 'something that didn't really start was
truly over',</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ce qui n'avait pas vraiment commencé était bel et bien fini.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he still searches for Émilie and tries to talk to her.</p>
<p>Émilie expresses similar thoughts when Jonas tries to meet her at the
bookshop where she worked in Oran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>— Ce ne sont que des mots, Younes. C'est vrai, il fut un temps où un
mot de toi aurait changé le cours du destin. Mais tu n'as pas osé le
prononcer. Il faut que tu comprennes que tout est fini. — Qu'est-ce qui
est fini, Émilie ? — Ce qui n'a jamais vraiment commencé.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonas probably didn't realize or didn't want to believe that it was
truly over.</p>
<p>Had it been before her marriage, it would have made a whole world of
difference as she said ('il fut un temps où un mot de toi aurait changé
le cours du destin').</p>
<p>Émilie did everything that she could. As a last resort, she even
begged Jonas to say yes so that she can call off her marriage with Simon
saying that he was the risk that she was willing to take:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>— Dis oui, Younes. Dis que tu m'aimes autant que je t'aime, que je
compte pour toi autant que tu comptes pour moi, prends-moi dans tes bras
et garde-moi contre toi jusqu'à la fin des temps… Younes, tu es le
destin que j'aimerais vivre, le risque que j'aimerais courir, et je suis
prête à te suivre au bout du monde… Je t'aime… Il n'y a rien ni personne
d'aussi essentiel à mes yeux que toi… Pour l'amour du ciel, dis oui…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Jonas couldn't utter even a syllable, leaving Émilie
disraught.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>— Pourquoi ne dis-tu rien ?… — … — Mais dis quelque chose, que diable
! Parle… Dis oui, dis non, mais ne reste pas comme ça… Qu'est-ce qu'il
t'arrive ? Tu as perdu la voix ?… Ne me torture pas, dis quelque chose,
bon sang!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Émilie curses Jonas and says that she'll never forgive him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>— Je te maudis, Younes. Je ne te le pardonnerai jamais, jamais…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe the curse was really meant. Jonas did suffer. But Émilie did
forgive him just before she died.</p>
<p>Jonas was too late in even attempting to express his feelings to
Émilie.</p>
<p>After her marriage and particulary after Simon's death, Émilie seems
to have been quite sad. This was on top of the suffering that she had
had due to Jonas.</p>
<h2 id="relationships-change">Relationships change</h2>
<p>No relationship stays as it was forever. That's how things are.</p>
<p>The gang was not friendly with Jonas till the incident with
Jean-Christophe. Then they became as close as the 'tines of a fork',
before slowly drifting apart.</p>
<p>For example, consider the conversation between Simon and Jonas just
before Simon reveals that he is about to marry Émilie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>La conversation m'irritait. Trop de fausses notes la
dénaturaient. Le Simon qui me tançait ne me convenait pas. Ce n'était
pas mon Simon, mon boute-en-train, mon confident et mon allié. Son
nouveau statut social l'avait éloigné du mien. Peut-être étais-je jaloux
de sa réussite, de sa nouvelle voiture flambant neuve qu'il aimait
oublier sur la place afin que les mioches essaiment autour, de son teint
de plus en plus éclatant et de sa bedaine rentrante ? Peut-être lui en
voulais-je de s'être associé avec Mme Cazenave ?… Faux ! C'était moi qui
avais changé. Jonas s'effaçait derrière Younes. Mes aigreurs prenaient
le pas sur ma nature. J'étais devenu méchant. Foncièrement méchant.
D'une méchanceté refoulée, jamais révélée, mais qui sourdait en moi
telle une indigestion. Je ne supportais plus les fêtes, les mariages,
les bals, les gens attablés sur les terrasses. J'étais allergique à leur
bonhomie. Et je haïssais !… Je haïssais Mme Cazenave. Je la haïssais de
toutes mes forces… C'est une toxine corrosive, la haine : elle vous
bouffe les tripes, vous squatte la tête, vous possède comme un djinn.
Comment en étais-je arrivé là ? Quelles étaient les raisons qui
m'avaient poussé à développer de la détestation à l'encontre d'une dame
qui ne m'importait plus ?… Quand on ne trouve pas de solution à son
malheur, on lui cherche un coupable. En ce qui me concernait, M me
Cazenave était le coupable désigné d'office. Ne m'avait-elle pas séduit
et abandonné ? N'était-ce pas à cause de ce dérapage sans lendemain que
j'avais été contraint de renoncer à Émilie?</em></p>
<p>I was finding the conversation irritating. There were too many false
notes. The Simon who was sitting across the table was not the Simon I
knew – the life and soul of the party, my confidant, my ally. In his
meteoric rise, he had left me far behind. Maybe I was jealous of his
success, of the new car he parked on the village square so the local
kids could crowd around and gawp, of his radiant health, the fact that
he had lost weight. Maybe I resented his partnership with Madame
Cazenave. But I knew it was none of these things. The fact was that I
was the one who had changed. Jonas was fading and Younes was coming to
the fore. I was becoming bitter and mean, a latent spitefulness, never
articulated, that welled in me like heartburn. I could no longer stomach
the parties, the weddings and the balls, the people on café terraces.
Their good humour irritated me. And I had learned to hate… I hated
Madame Cazenave, hated her with every fibre of my being. Hatred is
corrosive; it eats away at the soul, lives inside your head, takes
possession of you like a djinn. How had I come to loathe and despise a
woman who no longer meant anything to me? When you can find no reason
for your misery, you look for someone to blame. Madame Cazenave was my
scapegoat. Hadn't she seduced and abandoned me? Wasn't it because of
that fleeting mistake that she had made me swear to give up Émilie?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there's Germaine, who was effectively Jonas' own mother. Jonas
realizes that he has become distant from her as well when he talks to
her after being arrested for helping the FLN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My questions hurt her, more especially the way I had asked them. The
half-heartedness of my tone, the implicit criticism of what I was asking
turned her joy at having me back safe and sound into a vague feeling of
irritation and later mute anger. She looked at me and there was a
bitterness in her eyes I had never seen before. I realised that the ties
that had bound me to her had finally sundered. This woman, who had been
everything to me – mother, fairy godmother, sister, confidante, friend –
now saw me simply as a stranger.</p>
<p>Mes questions l'avaient blessée. En particulier, la manière dont je
les avais posées. La tiédeur de mon ton, le reproche qu'il
sous-entendait ramena sa joie de me récupérer sain et sauf à une
déception diffuse qui ne tarda pas à se muer en une sourde colère. Elle
leva sur moi un œil qui m'en voulait. Ce fut la première fois qu'elle me
regardait de cette façon. Je compris que le cordon qui me rattachait à
elle venait de s'effilocher, que la dame qui avait été tout pour moi –
ma mère, ma bonne fée, ma sœur, ma complice, ma confidente et amie – ne
voyait plus en moi qu'un étranger.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="émilie-bookshop-meet">Émilie bookshop meet</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>— Est-ce que je peux te poser une question, Younes ? La gorge nouée,
je ne pus que hocher la tête. — Pourquoi ?… Pourquoi m'as-tu repoussée
?… Si c'était pour une autre, tu l'aurais épousée et j'aurais compris.
Mais tu n'as toujours pas pris femme… Une larme profita d'un moment
d'inattention et parvint à se faufiler entre mes cils et à rouler sur ma
joue. Je n'eus pas le courage ni la force de l'intercepter. Aucun muscle
ne m'obéissait. — … Ça me travaillait jour et nuit, poursuivit-elle sur
un ton monocorde. Qu'avais- je de repoussant ? Quelle faute avais-je
commise ? Je me disais : Il ne t'aime pas ; c'est aussi simple que ça.
Il n'est pas obligé de te reprocher quoi que ce soit. Il n'éprouve rien
pour toi… Je n'arrivais pas à m'en convaincre. Tu étais devenu tellement
malheureux, après le mariage. Et là, j'ai pensé : Younes me cache
quelque chose… —… — Qu'est-ce que tu me caches, Younes ? Qu'est-ce que
tu ne veux pas me dire ? La digue céda ; mes larmes coulaient à flots,
cascadaient sur mes joues, inondaient mon menton et mon cou. Je
pleurais, et je me sentais me vider de mes tourments, de mes remords, de
mes parjures, tel un furoncle libérant son mal. Je pleurais comme une
ribambelle de mioches tant je ne souhaitais pas m'arrêter de pleurer. —
Tu vois ? me dit-elle. Tu ne veux toujours rien me dire. Quand je
relevai la tête, Émilie était partie. Comme si le mur derrière elle,
comme si la pénombre qui la voilait l'avait happée. Il n'y avait, dans
la boutique, que son odeur qui flottait parmi celle des livres et,
debout trois rayons plus loin, deux vieilles dames qui me regardaient
avec compassion. Je m'essuyai la figure et quittai la librairie avec le
sentiment qu'une brume émanant de nulle part était en train de
supplanter la lumière finissante du jour.</p>

<h2 id="interesting">Interesting</h2>
<p>Mahi shortly before his death:</p>

evils of this world. And remember this: if a woman loves you, no star is

<p>About souk days in Jenane Jato:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nightmares about it. The cleverest of all were the charlatans, who
stood babbling and gesticulating next to stalls filled with phials and
potions, gris-gris, amulets, and the dried corpses of animals famous for
their aphrodisiacal powers. They claimed they could cure deafness,
toothache, gout, paralysis, terror, barrenness, ringworm, insomnia, evil
spells and frigidity, and the credulous crowds fell for it. Some would
swallow one of these potions, and three seconds later would be rolling
in the dirt, claiming to have been miraculously cured. It was
astounding.</p>

<p>Well such things are still common. Even education couldn't eradicate
it.</p>
<hr />
<p>About Mahi and Germaine's enthusiasm at having Jonas with them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like two moths flickering around a flame, Germaine and my uncle
flitted around me constantly.</p>

<p>Initial enthusiasm is a factor I guess.</p>
<hr />
<p>About Ouari walking on even after seeing Jonas being bullied by
Daho:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it didn't matter now, he could laugh all he wanted. I didn't
care. Sadness had driven out fear: I no longer had a friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About Jean-Christophe's behavior seeing that Émilie was with
Fabrice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gossiped about their turbulent relationship. I watched as my friend
shrivelled. Usually Jean-Christophe was always quick to call attention
to himself; he loved to shout to people across the street, to stop
traffic, to yell to a barman for a beer. He had always been self-centred
and self-seeking, proud to be the centre of his own universe. Now he
could not bring himself to look people in the eye, pretended not to hear
when some called to him from across the road. He could be tortured by an
innocent smile and would analyse the least comment for some malicious
implication. He became quick-tempered, distant, and half mad with
heartache. I was worried about</p>

<p>André to Jonas when the former saw the wooden horse that
Jean-Christophe had gifted Jonas back in their school days:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Those were the good old days, weren't they, Jonas?'</p>
<p>‘Days don't get old, Dédé, we're the ones who get old.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>about being attracted to violence during the Algerian war:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I barely recognised myself. Like a moth to a candle flame I was drawn
to violence and to crowds. There could be no doubt: I was at war with
myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Uncle overheard Émilie's 2nd declrataion of love to Jonas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘If a woman loves you, Younes, if she truly loves you, and if you
have the wisdom to appreciate this great privilege, then there is no god
to touch you.'</p>

<p>Jérôme, Lucette's father, to an evangelist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>talked about God, believed in God – I was shocked to discover Jérôme
getting by without Him. Once, I overheard him tell an evangelist who
called to his house: ‘Every man is his own god. In choosing to follow
another god he denies himself and in doing so becomes blind and unjust.'
The evangelist looked at Jérôme as though he were the Devil
incarnate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lucette when Jonas was leaving Oran in his childhood:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lucette stood in the doorway of her house, hands behind her back,
leaning against the wall. She refused to believe me when I told her we
were moving away. Now, seeing the truck arrive, she was upset with me. I
couldn't bring myself to cross the street and tell her that I was upset
too. I simply stood and watched the movers load our furniture and our
trunks into the truck. It was as though they were taking my whole world
to pieces.</p>
<p>Germaine helped me up into the cab. The truck roared. I leaned out to
look back at Lucette, hoping she might wave; she kept her hands behind
her back. It was as though she didn't believe I was really leaving, or
perhaps she simply refused to accept it.</p>
<p>As the truck pulled away, the driver blocked my view of Lucette, so I
craned my neck in the hope of taking with me the glimmer of a smile,
some sign that she realised that this was not my fault, that I was as
devastated as she was. But nothing . . . The street flashed by in a roar
of metal and then disappeared.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Lucette.</p>
<p>For a long time I thought it had been her eyes that filled my soul
with a gentle peace. Now I know that it was not simply her eyes, it was
the way she looked at me – the gentle, caring, maternal expression of a
girl not yet a woman . . .</p>

<p>About some kids at school being friends for a reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>were quick to remind me of. Strangely, my chief weapon if I wanted
them to be my friends was my lunchbox. The moment I opened it, they
would crowd round and treat me with disarming respect. But as soon as I
had shared out my food and the last crumb had been eaten, they turned
their backs so fast it made my head spin.</p>

<p>Krimo in the cemetery before the reunion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘You poor fool. Don't you realise that one way or another, everyone
who survives a war is a traitor?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonas to Krimo at the cemetery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>any comfort, we're all in the same boat. We betrayed our martyrs, you
betrayed your ancestors, only to be betrayed in turn.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Krimo</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘The French have left. The Jews and the Gypsies have left. There's
just you lot left in Algeria, so why are you still slaughtering one
other?' — Les Français sont partis. Les juifs et les gitans aussi. Vous

<p>… ‘It's true, though, isn't it? What is it with the massacres, the
bombings that go on and on? You wanted independence – you've got it. You
wanted to decide your own fate? Fine! And what have you got? Civil war,
terrorists, the Armed Islamic Group. Isn't that proof enough that all
you people are good at is wrecking and killing?'</p>

<p>Jonas at hotel in bed after the reunion;</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Father</li>
<li>Mother, Zahra</li>
<li>Lucette</li>
<li>The gang</li>
<li>Émilie</li>
</ul>
<p>The novel depicts a way in which people who were once close drift
apart as life goes on like a river. People are floating down the river.
Some people happen to go through different routes like
distributories.</p>
<p>Sometimes people who had taken different routes come back together
like tributaries.</p>
<p>Jonas's first friend was probably his dog, with whom he had to part
when his family set out to Oran after losing their land to debtors.</p>
<p>Then his Father disappeared.</p>
<p>In Oran, there was Lucette whose friendship Jonas had to leave behind
when he moved to Rio Salado.</p>
<p>Then he finds that his mother and sister had disappeared.</p>
<p>He loses his status as Isabelle's 'fiancée' but at least she's still
there as a friend.</p>
<p>Then he loses Jean-Christophe due to Émilie. Gradually, the rest of
the gang.</p>
<p>Even Germaine… Jonas feels that even his effective mother has come to
regard him a stranger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mes questions l'avaient blessée. En particulier, la manière dont je
les avais posées. La tiédeur de mon ton, le reproche qu'il

regardait de cette façon. Je compris que le cordon qui me rattachait à
elle venait de s'effilocher, que la dame qui avait été tout pour moi –
ma mère, ma bonne fée, ma sœur, ma complice, ma confidente et amie – ne
voyait plus en moi qu'un étranger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No relation goes on forever..</p>
<p>José is murdered.</p>
<p>Simon dies. And then Émilie herself is lost to Jonas.</p>
<p>Much later, while in search of Émilie in Oran after Simon's death,
Jonas thinks that he saw a grown-up Lucette with a child. I wonder if
that was a figment of his imagination like the way he thought he saw his
father after the latter disappeared.</p>
<p>Algerian war ends. Lot of people Jonas knows leave.</p>
<p>Even later, Jean-Christophe reconciles with Jonas just as the latter
is about to return to Algeria after reunion at France.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>waiting at the foot of the crumbling wall. Only when I realised that
he always wore the same green jacket, which seemed to be untouched by
time and weather, did I finally understand that the man I saw was not
flesh and blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="later-life-of-jonas">Later life of Jonas</h2>
<p>Jonas later married and has three children. Two sons and
daughter.</p>
<p>By the time of the reunion. He also has five grandchildren.</p>
<p>Whom did Jonas marry though?</p>
<p>Could it have been Jamila? The daughter of the lawyer friend of Mahi
with whom Jonas used to exchange letters? Or Bernadette, with whom
Germaine tried to set him up? Or is it someone else?</p>
<p>Nothing is said about that.</p>
<h2 id="fate">Fate</h2>
<p>The following seems to hint at fate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had I known that a gust of wind can change the course of a life, I
might have been more wary, but at the age of seventeen, we all believe
we are invulnerable . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But his own actions afterwards defined his future. At least to a
certain extent, we ourselves determine our fate.</p>
<p>Like Jonas felt when Émilie talked about her love for the second
time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>l'ambiguïté de mon attitude, ma pleutrerie, mon inaptitude à trancher
une fois pour toutes et à rendre sa liberté et sa dignité à cette fille
prise en otage par mon indécision alors que je savais que notre histoire
n'aurait pas de suite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonas knew the reason. Indecisiveness and a form of cowardice. Maybe
he could at least have given her a hint of what prevented them being
together, or thrown away everything and told her the truth.</p>
<p>By not doing either, he tormented both Émilie and himself.</p>
<p>A lack of communication.</p>
<h2 id="madame-cazanave">Madame Cazanave</h2>
<p>I guess the author chose the name to make it resemble Casanova. She
is the one who brings about the torment of both Jonas and Émilie. She
seduced Jonas when she felt like it. For her, Jonas was a passing fancy.
Something to be used and thrown.</p>
<h2 id="émilie">Émilie</h2>
<p>She remembered his acquaintance though Jonas himself didn't. Though a
decade had passed.</p>
<p>She kept waiting for him for years. As long as she could.</p>
<p>I think Jonas should've told her the whole truth and let her decide
for herself. If she had the ability to accept Jonas's past and believe
in him, she is definitely the right person for Jonas. Otherwise it
wouldn't have worked.</p>
<p>Jonas thinks that a relationship with Émilie wouldn't last due to his
liaison with Mme Cazanave, though he does have feelings for Émilie.</p>
<p>Jonas should have given it a shot. He would've at least known where
he stood.</p>
<p>Émilie seems like a strong-willed person. She would've borne it. One
way or the other. And both Jonas and Émilie could've been spared the
torment that they would experience later.</p>
<p>Jonas should've told Émilie the truth. If she loved him enough and
her feelings were more than a youthful romance, she would've braved it
and forgiven him. If Émilie was the right person for Jonas, she would've
accepted his past and let him go forward.</p>
<p>That way a lot of mental torment could've been averted. Lack of
communication and then holding onto what <em>could</em> have been is
what caused all the trouble for their relationship.</p>
<h2 id="war">War</h2>
<p>Hinted at. Author seems careful not to justify any side too much.</p>
<h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>
<p>The ending where the aged Jonas sees all his friends, both living and
dead, waving him off at the airport in Marseilles as we was about to go
back to Algeria.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I arrive airside, I turn around one last time to see what I am
leaving behind, and I see them all, the living and the dead, standing at
the window waving me goodbye.</p>
<p>Au moment où je m'apprête à franchir le seuil de la zone franche, je
lève une dernière fois la tête sur ce que je laisse derrière moi et les
vois tous, au grand complet, les morts et les vivants, debout contre la
baie vitrée, en train de me faire des signes d'adieu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Émilie, Germain, Mahi, Jelloul..</p>
<p>The film's ending is beautiful as well. It involves a montage of the
people that Jonas had come across throught his life.</p>
<p>The old Jonas watches, his biological parents, his sister, the gang
when they were children, Madame Cazanave with Krimo, the gang when they
were youngsters… and Émilie.</p>
<p>Émilie and the old Jonas walks together and in the next shot the old
Jonas is replaced with his younger self. Émilie and Jonas walk a bit and
then turns towards each other and smiles.</p>
<p>My heart was unusually heavy and my eyes wet when I watched it.</p>
<p>It shows something that could've been. Or something that came to be
in after-life.</p>
<p>The quote from the book that appears on screen afterwards is a sad
one and leaves the audience with no opportunity to believe that it's a
happy ending.</p>
<p>But I think it's a happy ending.</p>
<p>Jonas and Émilie's love was real. But could it have lasted if they
had married? How would Émilie have reacted had she know about Jonas and
her mother?</p>
<p>Émilie couldn't figure out why Jonas was turning her away without an
explanation even when she expressed her feelings to him multiple times.
She was right in saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't understand what the problem is. I've told you how I feel
about you; what more can I do?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What more could she do?</p>
<p>It is much later, after her marriage, that she gets a hint of the
real problem. That Jonas is hiding something that he can't bring himself
to tell her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>— … Ça me travaillait jour et nuit, poursuivit-elle sur un ton
monocorde. Qu'avais- je de repoussant ? Quelle faute avais-je commise ?
Je me disais : Il ne t'aime pas ; c'est aussi simple que ça. Il n'est
pas obligé de te reprocher quoi que ce soit. Il n'éprouve rien pour toi…
Je n'arrivais pas à m'en convaincre. Tu étais devenu tellement
malheureux, après le mariage. Et là, j'ai pensé : Younes me cache
quelque chose… — … — Qu'est-ce que tu me caches, Younes ? Qu'est-ce que
tu ne veux pas me dire ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonas couldn't bring himself to answer her and breakes down into
tears. Émilie leaves him saying that he still can't talk to her.</p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>I recently watched the film <em>Ce que le jour doit à la nuit</em>
(What the day owed the night). It's a French language film set against
the backdrop of the Algerian war of independence. A chaotic period
notorious for the use of torture and terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>I liked the film and thought the novel on which it is based, written
Yasmina Khadra, would be an interesting. And it was.</p>
<p>I thought the film was good, but the novel was better.</p>
<p>After reading the novel, the film has lost some of its charm for me.
There are quite a few difference between the story in the book and the
film.</p>
<p>This also became an attempt of mine to learn to read French. I've
included some of my attempts to translate, which is bound to irritate
the reader.</p>
<h2 id="fln-commander-of-jelloul">FLN commander of Jelloul</h2>
<p>It was Ouari, Jonas's childhood friend from Jenane Jato. One with
whom he caught and sold birds for money.</p>
<p>Now known as Sy Rachid.</p>
<h2 id="cin">Cin</h2>
<p>The scene where story shifts from Jonas's childhood to adulthood was
nice. The boys are at the beach seeing how long they can hold their
breath under water. The dip into the water as boys and emerge out as
handsome grown ups, accompanied with some nice background music.</p>
<p>Good acting by a lot of actors. Mahi, Madelaine, etc. Patricularly
Émilie. Quite an energetic performance. The way she yells at Jonas when
he reaches out to touch Simon's dead body.</p>

<p>Jonas could find and talk to Émilie before she left Rio Salado after
Simon's death in the film. He couldn't in the novel, where Jonas later
find her in a bookshop.</p>
<p>Jonas has an actual conversation with Émilie in Marseilles in the
novel, unlike the film adaptation where Jonas just watches her.</p>
<p>Émilie actually goes on to say that Jonas doesn't owe her anything in
the novel during their last meeting.</p>
<h3 id="germainemadelaine">Germaine/Madelaine</h3>
<p>The woman who raised Jonas (I'll call her Jonas's mother) is named
Germaine in the novel, but in the film adaptation, it's Madelaine. Don't
know why the name was changed.</p>
<h3 id="novels-mentioned">Novels mentioned</h3>
<p>Novels of Albert Camus, who was born in Algeria, are mentioned. In
film, Fabrice reads out from Camus's 'Noces' (meaning 'Wedding') to
Helene. In novel, Mahi sends out Jonas to borrow Camus's 'La Peste'
(meaning 'The plauge') from the library. Jonas is surprised to find
Émilie working there instead of Madame Lambart.</p>
<p>In the film, Émilie gives Jonas the a copy of the book 'Le cheval
blanc' by Elsa Triolet. It doesn't appear in the novel, although 'La
Peste' was, like 'Le cheval blanc', published by Gallimard publishers.
There is some similarity to Jonas's story and Both Jonas and a character
in 'Le Cheval Blanc' cannot be with whom they love. Émilie describes it
as the 'story of a man whom the whole world loves but is incapable of
loving'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>l'histoire d'un homme dont tout le monde tombe amoureux mais qui est
incapable d'aimer</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="lucette">Lucette</h3>
<p>In the novel, there is Lucette, Jonas's best friend and neighbour
during his childhood when Mahi's pharmacy was in Oran. The characters of
Émilie and Lucette are sort of merged in the film version.</p>
<h3 id="the-rose-flower">The rose flower</h3>
<p>In the novel, Jonas first meets Émilie when she visits Mahi's
pharmacy for an injection which she takes every week. During one of
those visits, Jonas inserts a rose into one of her books. Émilie stops
coming to the pharmacy after a while and after waiting for a weeks,
Jonas forgets about her. But Émilie remembered Jonas. She knew that she
had come across him long ago when they met again. But Jonas didn't know
at the time that she still had that rose.</p>
<p>In the film, Émilie comes to Jonas's house to learn to play the piano
from Madelaine. There is no mention of Germaine being a pianist in the
novel.</p>
<p>In the novel, Émilie returns the rose that Jonas had put inside one
of her books during their childhood when Jonas doesn't say anything to
prevent her marriage to Simon. Jonas keeps this rose till the day he
visits Émilie's tomb where he scatters it.</p>
<p>In the film, Émilie keeps the rose and encloses it in her last letter
to Jonas. The flower being quite intact though it must be a few decades
old.</p>
<h3 id="racism-in-love">Racism in love</h3>
<p>In the film, Jonas tries to make Émilie believe that Jonas is
spurning her because of their different religions, whereas Jonas
explicitly tells Émilie that's not the reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>— Est-ce à cause de la religion ? C'est parce que je suis chrétienne
et vous musulman, c'est ça ? — Non. — Alors, de quoi s'agit-il ? Ne me
dites pas que je vous indiffère, que vous n'éprouvez rien pour moi. Je
suis femme, mon intuition est forte. Je sais que le problème ne se situe
pas à ce niveau. Je ne vois même pas quel problème il pourrait y avoir.
Je vous ai dit ce que je ressens pour vous. Qu'est-ce qu'il faudrait que
je fasse de plus ?</p>

<p>Film shows Simon silently suffering knowing that it is Jonas that his
wife loves. Novel doesn't say anything about that.</p>
<h3 id="émilies-last-letter">Émilie's last letter</h3>
<p>The contents of this letter is a bit different in the film
adaptation, where the letter ends with Émilie saying that Jonas was her
only true love ('mon seul amour').</p>
<p>Émilie is more loyal towards Simon in the novel version. Simon is not
even mentioned in the letter in the film.</p>

<p>Why would Jonas just nod his head and leave when seeing his close
friend Simon lying dead with his throat cut and Émilie and her son
finding shelter in the old stables? Just because Émilie didn't want to
see him (<code>Va-t'en</code>) and Krimo forced him to leave
(<code>Tu as entendu? Fous le camps.</code>)?</p>
<p>I expected Jonas to be in a state of mind where he wouldn't be moved
by threats or being yelled at.</p>
<p>Couldn't Jonas see that Émilie's and her son were still in danger?
Though Krimo is there. Their house is burning.</p>
<h3 id="what-made-émilie-forbid-jonas-touching-simon">What made Émilie

<p>When Jonas approaches Simon's dead body lying on ground, Émilie
screams at him:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Why did she do that? Was it because it was Jonas? Or would she have
done it no matter who it was?</p>
<p>She even instructed Krimo to throw Jonas out.</p>
<p>Why? In her despair, she seemed to have made Jonas a target of her
grief.</p>

<p>At Jonas's final meeting with his mother, she says this about his

sourde et muette. Mais elle comprend et apprend vite, m'a dit la
couturière.</p>
<p>She wasn't sick. Nor was she crazy. She's just deaf and dumb. But she
understands and learns quickly, the dressmaker tells me.</p>

<p>Night is obviously a reference to Émilie. Her black eyes find mention
many times.</p>
<p>For example, at the picnic:</p>
<blockquote>

qui m'obligèrent à détourner le regard.</em></p>
<p>The daugher of Madame Cazenave fixed on me her black eyes intensly
that I was obliged to look away.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Et ses yeux, mon Dieu ! irrésistibles, comment faisaient-ils pour
saturer les miens, se substituer à eux, passer au crible chacune de mes
pensées, intercepter la moindre interrogation me traversant l'esprit ?…
Et pourtant, malgré leur indiscrétion, je ne pouvais m'empêcher
d'admettre qu'ils étaient ce que la Beauté réussissait de mieux.
L'espace d'un fléchissement, je revis ceux de sa mère, dans cette grande
maison sur la piste du marabout – des yeux si radieux qu'on n'avait même
plus besoin d'allumer dans la chambre pour voir clair au plus profond de
nos choses tues, au plus secret de nos faiblesses refoulées… J'étais

<p>Par-dessus son épaule, je surpris le regard d'Émilie en train de
traquer le mien.</p>
<p>Over his shoulder, I saw Émilie's eyes seeking mine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was suspended in a void and Émilie's eyes were my only beacon</p>
<p>Every time her eyes met mine, they took away another fragment of my
being; like ancient battlements worn by time, I was crumbling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The eyes can lie, but the gaze cannot, and the glow in Émilie's was
fading fast. Whenever I was around, she would look at me imploringly. It
was pointless to turn away, since her distress signals reached me loud
and clear. Why me? I racked the depths of my brain. Why does she look at
me like this and never say anything?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Émilie standing in for Madame Lambert at Rio Salado book shop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She reappeared, her eyes more vast than a prairie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Émilie came to apologize to Jonas at the pharmacy for setting
off Jean-Christophe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My first thought was to throw her out..[sic].. when I looked into her
eyes, a horde of demons was set loose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there's this description of Émilie when Jonas tries to meet her
at the book shop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>she had appeared out of the half-light just as she had on the night
of the fire. A night she still wore about her, her black dress, black
hair, black eyes bearing mute witness to a grief a year had done nothing
to diminish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She realised she had hurt me. Something stirred in those dark eyes
filled with night. Something like a shooting star that flickered out as
soon as it appeared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose the day is Jonas?</p>
<p>Upon their last meeting in Marseilles,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Against all expectations, her dark look softened and her features
relaxed. She stared at me for a long time as though she were going far
back into the past to find me. Finally she came towards me, her perfume
hanging heavy in the air. She took my face in her hands the way my
mother used to do to kiss me on the forehead. Émilie did not kiss me on
the forehead, or on the cheek; she simply stared at me. Her breath
mingled with mine. I wanted her to hold my face like this until the Last
Judgement.</p>
<p>‘Nobody is to blame, Younes. You don't owe me anything. It's just the
way the world is, and I don't want that any more.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Émilie says that Jonas doesn't owe her anything. What did that
mean?</p>
<h2 id="germaine-mahi-vs-jonas">Germaine-Mahi vs Jonas</h2>
<p>The beautiful marriage of Germaine and Mahi is in stark contrast to
the Jonas's life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Il lisait, écrivait, souriait, sortait régulièrement flâner, Germaine
à son bras. J'adorais les voir marcher côte à côte au milieu de nulle
part, si fusionnels qu'ils n'accordaient que très peu d'attention au
monde alentour. Il y avait, dans la simplicité de leur rapport, dans la
fluidité de leur communion, une tendresse, une profondeur, une
authenticité qui les sanctifiait presque. Ils formaient le couple le
plus respectable qu'il m'ait été donné d'admirer. Les observer, tandis
qu'ils se suffisaient à eux-mêmes, m'insufflait un peu de leur plénitude
et me remplissait d'une joie belle comme leur bonheur pudique. Ils
étaient l'amour sans concession, l'amour parfait.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And about Isabelle's change after Jean-Christophe's return:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>thin he looked six inches taller. His hair was shaved, with a single
blonde lock that fell over his forehead. He wore a thick coat in spite
of the weather and limped slightly, leaning on a walking stick. Isabelle
was with him, holding his arm. I had never seen her so beautiful, so
down-to-earth. Her humility was almost admirable. They were walking
slowly and chatting. It was Isabelle who did the talking;
Jean-Christophe just nodded from time to time. They seemed to glow with
a sort of serene happiness, something ageless and enduring. I could not
help but feel a pang of affection for them, this couple who could grow
and mellow in silence and in questioning, made stronger by the
tribulations they had come through together. I felt my heart go out to
them, like a prayer that their reunion might last for ever. Perhaps
because seeing them reminded me of my uncle and Germaine strolling
through the orange groves. Seeing them together again, it was as though
nothing had ever happened. I realised that I could not but go on being
fond of one and loving the other. And yet I felt overwhelmed by a grief
as terrible as I had felt when my uncle had died.</p>

<h2 id="cover-of-original-french-title">Cover of original French
title</h2>
<p>The book cover has the picture of a woman wearing a broad-rimmed hat
with a ribbon on it, seated away from the camera looking slightly
towards her right.</p>
<p>I suppose it is Madame Cazanave (is her name meant to sound like
Casanova?), who plays a crucial role in the story. In fact, she may be
said to be the primary antagonist (discounting the Algerian war
itself).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting beneath a parasol, a woman gazed out at the horizon. She wore
a broad-brimmed hat with a red ribbon, dark glasses and a white swimsuit
that clung to her tanned body like a second skin.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Émilie did the right thing. She went on with her life when she
finally saw that there was no point waiting for Jonas. Jonas took much
longer before realizing that he had lost Émilie forever.</p>

<h2 id="could-the-french-have-prevented-independence">Could the French
have prevented independence</h2>
<p>Yes, I think. Provided no other resourceful country backed the
FLN.</p>
<p>France had a military. They could have suppressed them. But for how
long</p>
<p>If the FLN had the backing of other countries (maybe they actually
did), French government would've realized they would pay for it dearly
and thought it much cheaper to allow Algerian independence.</p>
<p>If the FLN didn't have backing of foreign elements, how were they
financed? How did they get armaments? Most likely, there were elements
who did some handsome war-profiteering (as is the case in any armed
conflict).</p>
<h2 id="tears">Tears</h2>
<p>A description of crying giving relief.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>La digue céda ; mes larmes coulaient à flots, cascadaient sur mes
joues, inondaient mon menton et mon cou. Je pleurais, et je me sentais
me vider de mes tourments, de mes remords, de mes parjures, tel un
furoncle libérant son mal. Je pleurais comme une ribambelle de mioches
tant je ne souhaitais pas m'arrêter de pleurer.</em></p>
<p>The dam burst; my tears flowed in streams, cascaded upon my cheeks,
inundated my chin and my neck. I cried, and I felt myself being drained
of my torments, my remorse, my lies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True. It's better to have good cry rather than holding on to what's
worry you. That's why I always prefer to leave people who are crying
alone. #INCOMPLETE</p>
