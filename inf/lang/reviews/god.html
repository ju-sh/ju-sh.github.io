<blockquote>
<p>And small fish appear in the puddles that fill the PWD potholes on
the highways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really? Fishes came into the potholes? Or is this an
exaggeration?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Slanting silver ropes slammed into the loose earth, ploughing it up
like gunfire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About rain 'drilling' into the soil.</p>
<hr />
<p>"<em>There goes a jazz tune</em>, Larry McCaslin thought to himself,
and followed her into a bookshop where neither of them looked at books."
About Rahel falling in love in Delhi.</p>
<p>"Rahel drifted into marriage like a passenger drifts towards an
unoccupied chair in an airport lounge. With a Sitting Down sense." Talks
about airport lounge as if it's accessible for a common man. Narrator is
obviously financially well-off.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Every night he beat her with a brass flower vase</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this was meant literally, sounds a bit implausible.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Then Chacko came home for a summer vacation from Oxford. He had grown
to be a big man, and was, in those days, strong from rowing for Balliol.
A week after he arrived he found Pappachi beating Mammachi in the study.
Chacko strode into the room, caught Pappachi's vase-hand and twisted it
around his back.</p>
<p>'I never want this to happen again,' he told his father. 'Ever.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very realistic in the bygone era. Sounds quite unlikely in the
present day Kerala.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>For the rest of the day Pappachi sat in the verandah and stared
stonily out at the ornamental garden, ignoring the plates of food that
Kochu Maria brought him. Late at night he went into his study and
brought out his favourite mahogany rocking chair. He put it down in the
middle of the driveway and smashed it into little bits with a plumber’s
monkey wrench. He left it there in the moonlight, a heap of varnished
wicker and splintered wood. He never touched Mammachi again. But he
never spoke to her either as long as he lived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Impotent rage. Powerless. Son dominating father. Most parents fear
such a scenario.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In the evenings, when he knew visitors were expected, he would sit on
the verandah and sew buttons that weren’t missing onto his shirts, to
create the impression that Mammachi neglected him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is still not uncommon.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The real blow came twelve years later, when, as a consequence of a
radical taxonomic reshuffle, lepidopterists decided that Pappachi’s moth
was in fact a separate species and genus hitherto unknown to science. By
then, of course, Pappachi had retired and moved to Ayemenem. It was too
late for him to assert his claim to the discovery. His moth was named
after the Acting Director of the Department of Entomology, a junior
officer whom Pappachi had always disliked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such scenarios happen all the time in workplaces, and will continue
to happen.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>A few months later Miss Mitten was killed by a milk van in Hobart,
across the road from a cricket oval. To the twins there was hidden
justice in the fact that the milk van had been <em>reversing</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humorous seeing that Miss Mitten was very much against the twins
reading sentences backwards.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>When the British came to Malabar, a number of Paravans, Pelayas and
Pulayas (among them Velutha’s grandfather, Kelan) converted to
Christianity and joined the Anglican Church to escape the scourge of
Untouchability. As added incentive they were given a little food and
money. They were known as the Rice-Christians. It didn't take them long
to realize that they had jumped from the frying pan into the fire. They
were made to have separate churches, with separate services, and
separate priests. As a special favour they were even given their own
separate Pariah Bishop. After Independence they found they were not
entitled to any Government benefits like job reser- vations or bank
loans at low interest rates, because officially, on paper, they were
Christians, and therefore casteless. It was a little like having to
sweep away your footprints without a broom. Or worse, not being allowed
to leave footprints at alf</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of the frying pan and onto the fire indeed…</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Mammachi (with impenetrable Touchable logic) often said that if only
he hadn’t been a Paravan, he might have become an engineer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Casteism of bygone days…</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>his gratitude to Mammachi and her family for all that they had done
for him, was as wide and deep as a river in spate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simile.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Vellya Paapen tried to caution Velutha. But since he couldn’t put his
finger oh what it was that bothered him, Velutha misunderstood his
muddled concern. To him it appeared as though his father grudged him his
brief training and his natural skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's isn't impossible for the father to have felt an ill will towards
his son for his skill. Remember the story of Perunthachchan?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>He stared straight ahead with his mortgaged eye. He wept with his own
one. One cheek glistened with tears. The other stayed dry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crying with one eye… the one he had left. What does a glass eye mean,
though?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>a face like a knot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can a face be like a knot?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Rahel smiled back at him, pleased to have Chacko mistaken for her
father. Like a normal family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Normal family'.. She missed a father figure that others associated
her with, it seems.. More about what the society thinks than the actual
presence of father.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Even behind her eyelids the light was bright and hot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I too used to think about it in my childhood.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>the coconut trees were sea anemones waving their tentacles, hoping to
trap and eat an unsuspecting cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>an interesting comparison.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The strange thing about Roman soldiers in the comics, according to
Rahel, was the amount of trouble they took over their armour and their
helmets, and then, after all that, they left their legs bare. It didn’t
make any sense at all. Weatherwise or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the real Roman soldiers were really dressed like that for
war..</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>At night, Estha would stand on his bed with his sheet wrapped around
him and say, '"Et tu? Brute? — Then fail Caesar!"' and crash into bed
without bending his knees, like a stabbed corpse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can relate this to what I used to do in childhood.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Her husband lit a bent after-biscuit cigarette. He exhaled two tusks
of smoke through his nostrils and for a fleeting moment looked like a
wild boar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A humourous and thoughtful, yet apt comparison.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>They remembered being pushed around a room once, from Ammu to Baba to
Ammu to Baba like billiard balls. Ammu pushing Estha away: 'Here, you
keep one of them. I can’t look after them both.' Later, when Estha asked
Ammu about that, she hugged him and said he mustn’t imagine things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he didn't imagine it right? He did hear his mother saying that..
It may be difficult for parents to openly admit that sometimes they hate
their own kids.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>A distant train rumble seeped upwards from the frog-stained road. The
yam leaves on either side of the railway track began to nod in mass
consent. <em>Yesyesyesyesyes</em>. …. …. The train was gone so quickly
that it was hard to imagine that everybody had waited so long for so
little. The yam leaves continued to nod long after the train had gone,
as though they agreed with it entirely and had no doubts at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A metaphor??</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Long before the Marxists came. Before the British took Malabar,
before the Dutch Ascendency, before Vasco da Gama arrived, before the
Zamorin’s conquest of Calicut. Before three purple-robed Syrian Bishops
murdered by the Portuguese were found floating in the sea, with coiled
sea serpents riding on their chests and oysters knotted in their tangled
beards. It could be argued that it began long before Christianity
arrived in a boat and seeped into Kerala like tea from a teabag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A concise, but probably biased, history of Kerala.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>before Christianity arrived in a boat and seeped into Kerala like tea
from a teabag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simile.</p>
<h2 id="c2-pappachis-moth">C2: Pappachi's moth</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>One of her ambitions was to own a watch on which she could change the
time whenever she wanted to (which according to her was what Time was
meant for in the first place).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only that was really the case…</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Silence filled the car like a saturated sponge. Washed-up cut like a
knife through a soft thing. The sun shone with a shuddering sigh. This
was the trouble with families. Like invidious doctors, they knew just
where it hurt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Family..</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>A gossamer blanket of coaldust floated down like a dirty blessing and
gently smothered the traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A metaphor?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>She (Baby kochamma) was annoyed that nobody asked her what a scree
bed was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well.. it happens..</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The crowd around the car unclotted and went on with its march.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A metaphor?</p>

<h2 id="c3-big-man-laltain-small-man-mombatti">C3: Big man laltain,

<blockquote>
<p>Silence hung in the air like secret loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simile.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>he wobbled off with less than half the money he had asked for and
less than a tenth of what he deserved.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The puppy seized the opportunity and tried to stage a combined entry.
Kochu Maria hit the floor fiercely with her palms and said, ‘Hup! Hup!
Poda Patti.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relatable for those with pet animals.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>'Watch!' Baby Kochamma said. She seemed excited. 'He’ll walk straight
to his room and wash his clothes. He’s very over- clean … he won’t say a
word.'</p>
<p>She had the air of a game warden pointing out an animal in the grass.
Taking pride in her ability to predict its movements. Her superior
knowledge of its habits and predilections. … … A gloating halo appeared
around Baby Kochamma’s head. 'See?' she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people find joy in such activities. An effort to command others'
respect.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Rahel watched his stomach suck inwards and his ribcage rise as his
wet T-shirt peeled away from his skin, leaving it wet and
honey-coloured. His face and neck and a V-shaped triangle at the base of
his throat were darker than the rest of him. His arms too were
double-coloured. Paler where his shirtsleeves ended. A dark brown man in
pale honey clothes. Chocolate with a twist of coffee. High cheekbones
and hunted eyes. A fisherman in a white-tiled bathroom, with sea-secrets
in his eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vivid details.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Estha’s hair was plastered down in clumps, like the inverted petals
of a flower. Slivers of white scalp shone through. Rivulets of water ran
down his face and neck.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c4-abhilash-talkies">C4: Abhilash talkies</h2>
<p>The child sexual abuse. How likely was such an event in Kerala of
1960s?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Rahel liked all this. Holding the handbag. Everyone pissing in front
of everyone. Like friends. She knew nothing then, of how precious a
feeling this was. Like Friends. They would never be together like this
again. Ammu, Baby Kochamma and she.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Then he smiled his portable piano smile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose the white teeth resembling the white keys of a piano is
what was meant.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>'We must go,’ she said. ‘Mustn’t risk a fever. Their cousin is coming
tomorrow,’ she explained to Uncle. And then, added casually, 'From
London.’</p>
<p>'From London?’ A new respect gleamed in Uncle’s eyes. For a family
with London connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was that just casually said or was it to evoke respect?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>‘What did, you say?’ Baby Kochamma said, getting the general drift,
but not what was actually said.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>his fever hot fingers whose tips were as cold as death.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Time stopped on the red staircase. Estha stopped. Baby Kochamma
stopped.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Frightened eyes and a fountain looked back at Aunmu.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>'What?' Rahel said in the smallest voice she had.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>He knew that if Ammu found out about what he had done with the
Orangedrink Lemondrink Man, she’d love him less as well. Very much less.
He felt the shaming churning heaving turning sickness in his
stomach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An environment where the kids can say anything to their parents can
help.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>There were more red steps to climb. The same red carpet from the
cinema hall was following them around. Magic flying carpet.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>A dinnerless niece and her dinnerfull uncle</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>When Rahel held her frothing toothbrush still and moved her teeth
instead, he didn’t say she mustn’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Rahel stood on a chair and unlatched the door for him.</p>
<p>Chacko didn’t bother to wonder how she could possibly have known that
Estha was at the dbor. He was used to their sometimes strangeness.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>He lay like a beached whale on the narrow hotel bed</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>His contract for printing the Paradise Pickles labels gave him an
income that he badly needed. He told himself that Chacko-the-client and
Chacko-the-Management were two different people. Quite separate of
course from Chacko-the-Comrade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hypocrisy?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>He would hold elections for them. Make them vote. They could take
turns at being elected representatives. He smiled at the idea of holding
round-table negotiations with Comrade Sumathi, or, better still. Comrade
Lucykutty, who had much the nicer hair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hypocrisy?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Of the coconut trees that bent into it and watched, with coconut
eyes, the boats slide by. Upstream in the mornings.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>On warm days the smell of shit lifted off the river and hovered over
Ayemenem like a hat.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>While fathers played sublimated sexual games with their nubile
teenaged daughters,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would all fathers be like that? Is the narrator a bit
prejudiced?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Comrade Pillai’s arms were crossed over his chest, and he clasped his
own armpits possessively, as though someone had asked to borrow them and
he had just refused.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Rahel tried to walk past unnoticed. It was absurd of her to have
imagined that she could.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Comrade Pillai uncrossed his arms. His nipples peeped at Rahel over
the top of the boundary wall like a sad St Bernard’s eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simile.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>"'Oower, oower, oower. In Amayrica now, isn’t it.’ It wasn’t a
question. It was sheer admiration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was, and to a great extent still is, the attitude among the
people in Kerala. Settled abroad means mean rich, riches mean people's
respect.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Comrade Pillai’s smile broadened as he turned all his attention like
a searchlight on Rahel.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>‘Die-vorced?’ His voice rose to such a high register that it cracked
on the question mark. He even pronounced the word as though it were a
form of death.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>They looked cheerful in the photographs, Lenin and his wife. As
though they had a new refrigerator in their drawing room, and a down
payment on a DDA flat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DDA is probably Delhi Development Authority.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Rahel remembered the incident that made Lenin swim into focus as a
Real Person for her and Estha, when they stopped regarding him as just
another pleat in his mother’s sari.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>They met in the clinic of Dr Verghese Verghese (Kottayam’s leading
Paediatrician and Feeler-up of Mothers). … … Little Lenin remained
behind to have his nostril probed by Dr Verghese Verghese’s cold steel
implements, and his mother probed by other, softer ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again what sounds like a prejudice against men on the side of the
narrator.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The slow ceiling fan sliced the thick, frightened air into an
unending spiral that spun slowly to the floor like the peeled skin of an
endless potato.</p>
