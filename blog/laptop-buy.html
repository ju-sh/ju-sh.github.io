<div id="description">
A non-comprehensive list of aspects to consider when buying a new laptop..
</div>

<hr/>

<div id="content-container">
<p>I needed to buy a new laptop recently (2021) and that led me to look through some of the laptops available in the market. Didn't know about hardware details, but friends (offline and online) helped me understand many things.</p>
<p>Here, I jot down a list of things that I went through before finally deciding on a laptop to buy. Intended mainly as a note for my future self.</p>
<p>I was looking for a laptop that could run Linux, while allowing me to avoid paying for a Windows license that I wouldn't need.</p>
<p><!-- Thanks to Kevin for his input --></p>
<h2 id="availability-of-device-driver-software">Availability of device driver software</h2>
<p>Having the device alone isn't enough. We would need suitable drivers to make them work so that they may be used. Make sure that appropriate drivers are available for the OS of your choice. Otherwise, problems like inability to change brightness of screen or suspend to disk might pop up to annoy the user.</p>
<h2 id="reviewsfeedback">Reviews/feedback</h2>
<p>Have a look what others who had bought the laptop have to say about the product by going through the reviews and ratings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it get heated up fast?</li>
<li>How long did were you able to use the laptop before it got beyond repair?</li>
<li>How resilient is the body build? Can it withstand some rough handling or does is it delicate?</li>
<li>Is battery life okay? Was it good at first and then go down?</li>
<li>How was customer support from the manufacturer and seller?</li>
<li>Are spare parts easily available?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="case-body">Case / body</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build</strong>: Is it too fragile? Does it always require careful handling? Or can it withstand some rough use?
<ul>
<li>Does the case look sturdy enough to protect the computer?</li>
<li>TL;DR: is the body too flimsy? Often slimness comes at the cost of lesser body strength.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: Plastic / metal?</li>
<li><strong>Colour</strong>: What colour laptop would you like?
<ul>
<li>For instance, white can get noticeably dirty faster though it can get attention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Finishing</strong>: if the case is too smooth, impressions of finger print may be too visible.
<ul>
<li>Glossy / matte ?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Location of fan ventilation</strong>: Is it on the side or is it near the hinges?
<ul>
<li>It might be easier for us to block the air flow (without even realizing it) if it is on the side.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: Like 360 x 235 x 19.9mm</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong>: &lt;= 1.6 kg would be cool.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="warranty">Warranty</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: How many years?
<ul>
<li>Should be <em>at least</em> one year.</li>
<li>3 years would be better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Extended warranty</strong>: Many dealers would offer to extend warranty duration for an additional fee. Haven't found many people who found this to be benefitial (in fact, haven't found even one).</li>
<li><strong>Types of damage covered</strong>: What kinds of damage are not covered (eg: Fire damage)</li>
<li><strong>Parts covered</strong>: Which all parts are covered by the warranty</li>
<li><strong>Start of warranty period</strong>: When will the warranty period be considered to have begun?
<ul>
<li>Is it date on which computer is ordered or date on which it was delivered to us?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Damaged on delivery</strong>: How will the company handle it if the computer was delivered in a damaged condition? (assuming that the order was placed online)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="claiming-warranty">Claiming warranty</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to claim</strong>: How easy is it to claim warranty?
<ul>
<li>Do we got to send the computer to them or will they pick it up from us or do we have to deliver it somewhere?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Data security</strong>: Security of our data while sent for repair under warranty.
<ul>
<li>Will those who repair the device have access to data in our computer?</li>
<li>Would the data in the computer be lost?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Refurbished parts</strong>: Will old parts be used while reparing the product even when it is under warranty? (Usually they do).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-installed-software">Pre-installed software</h2>
<ul>
<li>Operating system (OS)</li>
<li>Other software (like MS Office)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-to-look-at">Things to look at</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating system</strong>: Does it come with an OS pre-installed?
<ul>
<li>Linux / Windows / No OS</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>License validity</strong>: How long is the software license valid?
<ul>
<li>Lifetime / few years?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>License type</strong>: What kind of license?
<ul>
<li>Enterprise / Home</li>
<li>Features available may vary with the kind of license.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>(Opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li>With regard to OS, I feel that Windows is best avoided. Linux is usually better and more respectful of the user's privacy</li>
<li>LibreOffice usually gets the job done if you would rather not cough up for a MS Office license.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="graphics-card">Graphics card</h2>
<p>If the laptop would be used to run heavy simulations or gaming, better to go with a separate graphics card.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated or standalone graphics?
<ul>
<li>AMD Radeon</li>
<li>Intel</li>
<li>NVidia</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Capacity of the graphics card in GB.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="power">Power</h2>

</ul></li>
<li>Wattage: Eg: 65W</li>
<li>Operating temperature range</li>
<li>Allowed temperature range while recharging battery</li>
<li>Allowed temperature range while in storage</li>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Manufacturer</strong>: Is it made by a reputed company?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="speaker">Speaker</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of speakers</strong>: Usually two</li>
<li><strong>Position of speakers</strong>: Sometimes less audible if placed under the laptop,</li>

<li><strong>Number of keys</strong>: Are there sufficient keys?
<ul>
<li>Two Ctrl/Super/Alt keys? Or just one of each?</li>
<li>Do some keys double up to act as another when pressed in combination with a modifier key? (Like volume control and function keys, page up/down, print screen)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Key size</strong>: Are the keys big enough?
<ul>
<li>Some models have arrows keys too small, for instance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ease of typing</strong>: Is it comfortable to type with?
<ul>
<li>Especially important for touch typists.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Numberpad keys</strong>: Does it have separate number keys?
<ul>
<li>Usually not available in 14" screen laptops.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Unusual key positions</strong>: Are any keys placed in an unusual position?
<ul>
<li>Depends on the model. For example, ThinkPads have page up/down buttons place near the arrow keys.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Backlit</strong>: Is it a backlit keyboard?</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: It's probably a chiclet keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<li>Any fancy screws that require special screw-drivers?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="portsjacks">Ports/jacks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>HDMI/VGA ports</strong>: For display
<ul>
<li>VGA is larger and less likely to be available in newer laptops that aim for slimness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ethernet port</strong>: RJ45 jack to connect to a LAN.
<ul>
<li>Can buy an RJ45 to USB adapter if not present. But we would have to carry it around all the time.</li>

<p>Age of CDs and DVDs seems to be over. But if you got a CD collection, then you might need a CD/DVD reader/writer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand</strong>: Which brand?</li>
<li><strong>Writer</strong>: Can it also write to CD/DVDs? Or just read?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ram">RAM</h2>
<p>If you plan to use multiple RAMs, be a bit careful. They may not work well together. Check their frequencies. Probably better if all RAMs are of the same brand.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology</strong>: DDR3,DDR4 etc.
<ul>
<li>DDR4 seems good now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: What is the frequency at which the RAM operates?</li>

# TODO: SATA/NVMe difference?
# TODO: Good brand for SSDs? --></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: Storage capacity of the disk</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong>: HDD or SSD?
<ul>
<li>Both HDD and SSD have their pros and cons, it seems.</li>
<li>HDDs are more durable but SSDs are way faster.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: Like 2.5" or 3.5"</li>
<li><strong>Extra slots</strong>: Are there slots to install more disks?</li>
<li><strong>Expandable upto</strong>: Upto what limit can we expand the secondary storage capacity?</li>
<li><strong>Interface</strong>: SATA / NVMe
<ul>
<li>SATA is for HDDs. SSDs can use NVMe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Manufacturer</strong>: Is it of a reputed brand?
<ul>
<li>For HDDs, WD and Seagate are good.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="processor">Processor</h2>
<p><!--
# TODO: Hyperthreading
# TODO: Base clock. --></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand</strong>: Essentially an 'Intel or AMD' question these days.
<ul>
<li>AMD is usually cheaper for similar specs.</li>
<li>Heard people saying that in terms of single-core performance, Intel is better. But AMD trumps Intel in terms of multi-core performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: Like i3,i5,i7 or Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Generation</strong>: Later generations are usually more capable.</li>
<li><strong>Number of cores</strong>: More cores, the better (and expensive). Usually dependent on the model and generation.</li>
<li><strong>Number of threads per core</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthreading">Hyperthreading</a> can mean 2 threads per core.</li>
<li><strong>Clock speed</strong>: Frequency at which the processor operates.
<ul>
<li>Base clock speed: normal speed. Gaming laptops often have a higher base clock frequency.</li>
<li>Boosted clock speed: maximum speed (will get heated up fast at this speed)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monitor-display">Monitor display</h2>
<p><!--
# TODO: Refresh frequency
# TODO: Aspect ratio
# TODO: Contrast ratio
# TODO: Colour gamut --></p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Can come in useful sometimes. Like while making presentations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: Influences picture quality. Like: 1920 x 1080px</li>
<li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: In inches. Like 14", 15.6", etc.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong>: Influences the picture quality.
<ul>
<li>TN (Twisted Nematic)</li>
<li>IPS: Considered better than TN</li>
<li>LED/LCD</li>
<li>FHD/HD</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Viewing angle</strong>: Maximum angle at which picture can be viewed without distortion. Like 90°, 170°, etc.
<ul>
<li>Depends on the technology used.</li>
<li>IPS has larger viewing angle than TN.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Touch screen</strong>: Supports touch input? Means more money.</li>
<li><strong>Anti glare</strong>: Less ambient reflection.
<ul>
<li>Quite useful to have.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Refresh frequency</strong>: frequency at which pixels are refreshed??</li>
<li><strong>Brightness</strong>: Usually given in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_per_square_metre">nits</a> (a unit for brightness)</li>
<li><strong>Aspect ratio</strong>: Like 16:9.</li>
<li><strong>Contrast ratio</strong>: Like 500:1, 700:1, 1200:1, etc</li>
<li><strong>Color gamut</strong>: Like 45% NTSC, 100% sRGB, etc
<ul>
<li>Very important for graphic designers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="battery">Battery</h2>
