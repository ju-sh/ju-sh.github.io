<div id="description">
A puzzle that illustrates how a solution to a problem can sometimes be arrived at using the solution to a simpler, related problem.
</div>

<p>Our college used to run a math circle before covid hit. It was officially rejuvenated last week. A day of introductory sessions meant to encourage an interest in investigating mathematical puzzles among the potential participants was arranged. I sat through almost all of them, and boy, was it worth it.</p>
<p>Some of the participants, who were probably pre-high school, had more mathematical insights than I did. ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>Anyway, before the actual sessions started, one of our teachers showed a small puzzle as sort of an appetizer.</p>
<p>It showcased a way of thinking about an answer to a problem like Polya mentions in <em>How to solve it</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The puzzle looked difficult when I looked at it, but the solution felt so obvious after the answer was revealed to us.</p>
<p>Solution to this puzzle may be evident for some, but it certainly wasn't the case for me at first. And it's a simple puzzle, so I thought I would write about it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-puzzle">The puzzle</h2>
<p>Consider a square with 3 pairs of points laid out like this:</p>
<pre><code>                A
 +-----------------------------+
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
B|          C&#39;      B&#39;         |C
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 +-----------------------------+
                A&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>A and A' are aligned along the same vertical line. And the points B, B', C, C' are aligned such that they fall on the same horizontal line.</p>
<p>The question is, can we connect the following pairs of points without any of the connections crossing each other?</p>
<ul>
<li>A-A'</li>
<li>B-B'</li>
<li>C-C'</li>
</ul>
<p>The lines/curves connecting the point pairs cannot go outside the square.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the square itself doesn't connect any points. It's just there as a 'frame'.</p>
<p>ie, for example, A and B are not connected by the edges of the square.</p>
<h2 id="an-attempt">An attempt</h2>
<p>When the puzzle was posed, I couldn't go beyond connecting two pairs of points.</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>                A
 +-----------------------------+
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |        +------+             |
 |       /        \            |
B|------+  C       B&#39;  +-------|C
 |          \         /        |
 |           +-------+         |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 |                             |
 +-----------------------------+
                A&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>Because now the BB' and CC' seem to block the way for us to have AA'.</p>
<p>We had a minute or two before the solution was revealed, but I still couldn't see a way out.</p>
<p>All I couldn't think of way drawing a connection that went outside the square. Like:</p>
<pre><code>+---------------------+
|                      \ A
|        +--------------+--------------+
|        |                             |
|        |                             |
|        |                             |
|        |                             |
|        |                             |
|        |        +------+             |
|        |       /        \            |
|       B|------+  C       B&#39;  +-------|C
|        |          \         /        |
|        |           +-------+         |
|        |                             |
|        |                             |
|        |                             |
|        |                             |
|        |                             |
|        +--------------+--------------+
|                      / A&#39;
+---------------------+
</code></pre>
<p>But this isn't a solution since the connections cannot go outside the square.</p>
<h2 id="a-simpler-related-problem">A simpler, related problem</h2>
<p>Okay, we couldn't make much headway in solving the original puzzle.</p>
<p>But remember what was mentioned in <em>How to solve it</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All right, a related problem it is then.</p>
<p>Here is a simpler, related problem:</p>
<pre><code>                A
 +-----------------------------+
 |                             |

B|          B&#39;      C&#39;         |C

 +-----------------------------+
                A&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>This is a cakewalk as after drawing the BB' and CC', we get some space through which we can draw AA'.</p>
<pre><code>                A
 +-----------------------------+

<p>Now we'll see if we can use the solution to this problem to find a solution to our original problem.</p>
<h2 id="way-to-a-solution">Way to a solution</h2>
<p>Okay, we got a solution to the simpler problem ready.</p>
<p>Let's see if we can use it to arrive at a solution for the original problem.</p>
<p>Try moving the points in the simpler problem a bit, adjusting the connections between the points accordingly.</p>
<p>First, let's move B' a bit to the top-right.</p>
<p>(To make the diagram clearer, I'm making the AA' connection in bold).</p>
<pre><code>                A

<p>Then C' toward bottom-left.</p>

<p>And we end up with a solution to our original problem.</p>
<p>That was it!</p>
<p>After knowing the answer, it looks too simple. But it certainly didn't look simple when we first encountered it. ðŸ˜Š</p>

<p>But I went with square because it's faster to make ASCII art of squares when compared to circles. Though the artist-mode of emacs makes it easier even for circles. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
