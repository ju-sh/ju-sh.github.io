An example from Polya's 'How to solve it'.

<main id="content-container">
<p>I recently read a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It"><em>How to Solve it</em></a> by the Hungarian mathematician <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Polya/">George Polya</a> (Pólya György) and found a nice example of how basic math can be used in every-day life to infer practically useful information.</p>
<p>It's named 'A rate problem' and appears in Part I.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I try to retell it. 😊</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Consider a vessel in the shape of a hollow inverted right-circular cone with horizontal base. The base of this cone is the opening of the vessel.</p>
<p>Measurements of the cone are:</p>
<ul>
<li>base radius: a.</li>
<li>height: b</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose water is entering into this vessel at a rate r.</p>
<p>We need to find the rate at which the water level is rising inside the vessel when the water level is at a height y from the pointed end of the cone.</p>
<p>The overall setup looks something like:</p>
<pre><code>            a

  |             \ . /             |

<p>Let's write down the data we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>base radius of the conical vessal: a.</li>
<li>height of the conical vessel: b</li>
<li>rate at which water is flowing into the vessel: r</li>
<li>current water level: y</li>
</ul>
<p>What we need to find is:</p>
<ul>
<li>rate at which y is increasing as water is flowing at the rate r.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the water level changes as time goes by since more water is entering the vessel without the vessel losing any of the water that's already inside it.</p>
<p>So we can say the y is a function of time t.</p>
<p>ie, the rate at which y increasing means rate at which the water level y is changing with respect to time.</p>
<p>Then what we need to find is:</p>
<pre><code> dy
────
 dt
</code></pre>
<p>(Because derivative of a function gives with respect to a variable gives the rate of change of that function with respect to that variable.)</p>
<p>All right, we have now got a notation/name for what we need to find out.</p>
<p>Now we need to find a relation between the information that we know and this <code>dy/dt</code>.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the water that's already inside the vessel, even as more water is entering the vessel at rate r.</p>
<p>We can see that the water that's already inside the vessel assumes the shape of a cone as well.</p>
<p>Let x be the radius of the base of this cone.</p>
<pre><code>            a        x

<p>Volume of a right circular cone is given by:</p>
<pre><code> πr²h
──────
  3   

where r is radius of base and h is height.
</code></pre>
<p>So the volume of water that's already inside the vessel when the water level is y is</p>
<pre><code>     πx²y
V = ──────
      3   
</code></pre>
<p>Like in the case of the water level, the volume of water inside the vessel increases as time goes by. So <code>V</code> is a function of <code>t</code> as well.</p>
<p>So the rate at which volume of water changes is:</p>
<pre><code> dV
────
 dt
</code></pre>
<p>But we already know that water is entering the vessel at a rate r.</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre><code>     dV
r = ────
     dt
</code></pre>
<p>Now, for a moment, consider the 3D vessel in 2D.</p>
<p>So it is like:</p>
<pre><code>            a        x 
       +----------+------+

  |            \  |  /            |            
  |             \ | /             |

                  A
</code></pre>
<p>where the vessel corresponds to ΔABC and the cone formed by the water that's already inside the vessel corresponds to ΔAMN.</p>
<p>Let's have a closer look at these two triangles.</p>
<pre><code>∠BAC = ∠MAN   (same angle)
∠ABC = ∠AMN   (since BC ‖ MN)
</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>ΔABC</code> and <code>ΔAMN</code> are similar triangles (by AA similarity criterion).</p>
<p>ie,, <code>ΔABC ~ ΔAMN</code></p>
<p>This means that the ratio of any two corresponding sides would be the same.</p>
<pre><code>   OM     AO
  ──── = ────
   PB     AP


    x     y
=&gt; ─── = ───
    a     b


         a.y 
=&gt;  x = ──────  
          b
</code></pre>
<p>Cool! We got a relation between the base radius of the water cone and <code>a</code>, <code>y</code> &amp; <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>Now recall that</p>
<pre><code>         πx²y
   V  = ──────
          3


         πx²y     π(a.y/b)²y 
=&gt; V  = ─────  = ───────────── 
          3           3      


         πa²y²y
=&gt; V  = ───────
          3b²

         3b²V
=&gt; y³ = ──────
          πa² 
</code></pre>
<p>Differentiating on both sides with respect to t,</p>
<pre><code>     dy      3b²     dV
3y².──── = ────── * ────
     dt      πa²     dt

(∵ a, b, h, etc are all constants.)


    dy        3b²       dV  
=&gt; ──── = ────────── * ────
    dt     3y²*2πa²     dt


    dy        b²       dV
=&gt; ──── = ───────── * ────
    dt     y²*2πa²     dt
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it! We have got <code>dy/dt</code>, which is what we were after.</p>
<p>Let's try an example case.</p>
<p>Suppose the values of constants were like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a = 4m</li>
<li>b = 3m</li>
<li>r = dV/dt = 2ms⁻¹</li>
<li>y = 1m</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the rate at which the water level is rising would be:</p>
<pre><code>    dy         3²         
=&gt; ──── = ────────── * 2   
    dt     1²*2π*4²       


               3²   
        = ─────────────
           1² * π * 4² 

               9    
        = ─────────────
              16π 
</code></pre>
<p>So, if the conical vessel is of height 3m with base radius 4m, the water level inside it rises at a rate of 9/16π ms⁻¹ when the water level is 1m..</p>
