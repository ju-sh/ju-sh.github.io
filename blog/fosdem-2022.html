About stuff that I did and saw at FOSDEM 2022.
</div>

<div id="content-container">
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/about/">FOSDEM</a> <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2022/">2022</a> happened a couple of weeks ago
(Feb 5 and 6) and it was great. I did some each of attending,
volunteering and speaking and met many interesting people along the
way.</p>
<p>This year, FOSDEM had: <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/">¬π‚Å¥</a></p>
<ul>
<li>654 speakers</li>
<li>731 events</li>
<li>100 tracks</li>
<li>19 lightning talks*</li>
</ul>
<p>(More interesting figures were mentioned in the <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/closing_fosdem/">closing
talk</a>.)</p>
<h1 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h1>
<p>True to its spirit, FOSDEM 2022 seems to have been done entirely
using FOSS software.</p>
<p>Like in 2021, matrix was used for chatting.</p>
<p>This time, a relatively new feature of Matrix, called <a
href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-the-next-frontier/">Spaces</a>, was
used (as <a
href="https://seagl.org/news/2021/10/27/seagl-2021-theme.html">SeaGL did
in 2021</a>). Spaces allowed for organizing the different chat rooms
into a proper hierarchy.</p>
<p>These are some of the tools that were used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix: Chat</li>
<li>Jitsi: Live video</li>
<li>SReview: Recordings review</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of matrix meant decentralization. Federation.</p>
<p>Each track/devroom had an associated matrix channel from where
audience could watch the talk being broadcast by means of matrix widget.
Questions and comments could be posted to the same channel.</p>
<p>The talks were pre-recorded. After the video playback is over, the
remaining time would be for Q&amp;A. (If the recording was too long, it
would cut into the time for Q&amp;A. If the recording exceeded the
allotted time slot, the video itself would be cut off abruptly once the
allotted time expires).</p>
<p>Each talk had a room associated with it. This room would not be
public initially and would be the place where the speaker and host can
communicate. There is a jitsi widget in this room where the speaker and
host can join live video which would be broadcast to the corresponding
track/devroom. The Q&amp;A session happens here in this manner. Once the
time for the talk is over, the a bot would make the room public (without
sharing chat history prior to this point) and the same room would become
the hallway for the talk where people can come in and join the video
call with the speaker and host and have discussions.</p>
<p>Audience could vote on the questions posted in the chat and they
would appear in reverse order of upvotes in a widget in the speaker's
room to be answered during the Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>Each track had a backstage room, but I felt that there wasn't much
activity there except the bot warning about people who were expected to
be there but hadn't yet showed up, but maybe that's just the backstage
rooms that I had popped into.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that anything which had a chance of being automated
was automated. Like (FOSDEM bot) inviting speakers and volunteers to the
correct rooms, ensuring that the speaker and host showed up, generating
new invites every now and then depending on external changes like a new
volunteer being available, etc.</p>
<p>The people managing the infrastructure did a great job. Except for
one small gitch on day 1 (which was fixed within a few minutes) where
the Q&amp;A wasn't being broadcast in some rooms, I don't think there
was any problem for an attendee.</p>
<p>I haven't seen it yet, but an overview FOSDEM infrastructure was
given as a <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/conference_fosdem/">talk</a>
during the conference itself.</p>
<h1 id="attending-and-speaking">Attending and speaking</h1>
<p>I attended a few talks (don't ask how many, I have no idea) and these
are a few among them</p>
<h2 id="history-of-spreadsheets">History of spreadsheets</h2>
<p><a
href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/retro_spreadsheets/">A
Brief History of Spreadsheets: From LANPAR to VisiCalc to Lotus to
LibreOffice</a> was very interesting. It was given by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Hall_(computer_programmer)">Jim
Hall</a>, the guy who started making <a
href="https://www.freedos.org/">FreeDOS</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't even know there were things like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet#LANPAR_spreadsheet_compiler">LANPAR</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc">VisiCal</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a>, and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quattro_Pro">Quattro Pro</a> before
the kind of spreadsheets that we usually use these days and the story of
how the rows in modern spreadsheets came to be named with numbers and
columns with letters. The talk also involved demos these tools.</p>
<p>Not sure if it's so, but I got the impression that the demand for
spreadsheet software back in the day played a role in the subsequent
popularity of personal computers and the emergence of Microsoft.</p>
<h2 id="raku">Raku</h2>
<p>Had heard about <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a> but never got to
take a closer look. This <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/misc_raku/">talk</a> about
the language and the subsequent discussion gave me some insights.</p>
<p>Having initially started out as Perl 6 (there's a hint of that in
Camelia, Raku's mascot), Raku grew to be something different.</p>
<p>Raku has no reference implementation (unlike languages like Python)
and <a href="https://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> (meaning 'way of the camel'
according to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakudo">Wikipedia</a>, a reference
towards Raku's Perl heritage) seems to be the only implementation that's
active.</p>
<p>Also heard about <span class="spurious-link"
target="33"><em>MoarVM</em></span>, <span class="spurious-link"
target="34"><em>NQP</em></span> and <a
href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars">grammars</a> of Raku
(Raku parser itself seems to be using this kind of grammars). Got to
look up on that when I get time (don't know when that will happen
though..üòÖ)</p>
<h2 id="electronics-with-open-source">Electronics with open source</h2>
<p>Found from <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/coriolis2/">talks</a> <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/nmigen/">in the</a>
<em>Libre-Open VLSI and FPGA devroom</em> about the <a
href="http://coriolis.lip6.fr/">Alliance/Coriolis</a> toolchain, <a
href="https://gitlab.com/nmigen/nmigen">nMigen HDL</a> and the <a
href="https://libre-soc.org/">Libre-SOC project</a>.</p>
<p>At first I thought <em>Hardware-Aided Trusted Computing devroom</em>
would be about formal methods as well, but based on quick glance at the
list of talks there, it seems that isn't the case (it sounded more in
the line of stuff like Trusted Platform Module aka TPM). Not sure if I'm
wrong though.</p>
<p>I wanted to see the events in the <em>Hardware-Aided Trusted
Computing devroom</em>, as I am working on a project in that area using
formal methods, but couldn't attend it live (videos must be there
though).</p>
<h2 id="unified-push">Unified-Push</h2>
<p>Listening to the <a
href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/rtc_unifiedpush/ ">talk</a>
about <a href="https://unifiedpush.org/">Unified Push</a>, I got the
impression that things are be a bit messed up in the Android world and
that people are trying to fix that.</p>
<h2 id="ada">Ada</h2>
<p>I listened to a few talks in the <em>Ada devroom</em>, but being a
total stranger to the language, didn't understand much.</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>I was one of the speakers in the <em>Python devroom</em> and in
between I couldn't attend most of the talks there (but then again,
recordings are there!).</p>
<p>And the name of the <em>Open Research Tools and Technologies
devroom</em> sounded like it would have interesting talks, got to look
into it.</p>
<h1 id="volunteering">Volunteering</h1>
<p>I had volunteered to be one of the people manning the infodesk for
some time at FOSDEM 2021. I didn't do much as I didn't know the answer
or fix to most of the questions that had come up. But it was fun (and I
had someone I had already met before online as fellow infodesker).</p>
<p>I wanted to volunteer to do hosting as well last year, but the place
where I was at back in 2021 had poor internet connectivity that wouldn't
stand video calls. But things changed as the place I am at now in 2022
has <em>very</em> good Internet. So the moment I heard the volunteers
were called for this year's FOSDEM, I signed up to do hosting.</p>
<p>I had initially signed up to host two talks but that ended up being
four once the conference had started (mainly in the <em>Real Time
Communications</em> track) and I got to meet even more cool people!</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>With its latest edition, FOSDEM once again showed that it is
perfectly possible to hold a giant conference online with open source
software.</p>
<p>Now that the effects brought about by corona are receding, next
FOSDEM will probably be a physical event again.</p>
<p>Sort of has mixed feeling about that, as I was able to attend FOSDEM
only because it became online. There will be live video streams of talks
regardless of whether the event is online or offline, but hopefully
there will be a way to interact as well, but then again that may be
asking too much.</p>
<p>Well, till the next FOSDEM then.</p>
<p>In case you have missed any of the talks at FOSDEM 2022, all the
recordings would probably become available soon enough (if it isn't
already, that is). I missed a few talks myself and am planning to watch
the videos. Cheers!</p>
