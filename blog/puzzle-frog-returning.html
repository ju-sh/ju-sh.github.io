Is it possible for a frog to return to starting position subject to some
conditions? A puzzle..
</div>

<div id="content-container">
<p>â€”</p>
<p>A group of students and teachers from our college used to run a math
circle for the students of nearby schools before Covid struck.
Apparently it used to be quite active. Now that the lockdown era is
over, the math circle is being resurrected.</p>
<p>A bunch of volunteers including our teachers are working to get the
programme running and one of my friends was among those who were tasked
with finding math problems to help the participants of the math circle
develop greater interest in mathematics.</p>
<p>So my friend spent some time searching for math puzzles and found a
few. One of them was quite simple to understand (once we got to know the
answer, that is ðŸ˜…) and he told us about it.</p>
<p>I try to describe this puzzle and its solution in this blog post.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-puzzle">The puzzle</h2>
<p>Imagine a frog which can only move horizontally towards left or
right. It cannot move in any other direction.</p>
<p>When it moves for the first time, it takes one step. During each
successive move it makes afterwards, it takes one step more than the
number of steps it took during the previous move.</p>
<p>It will be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>| Move#      | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | .....
|------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----|
| Step count |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 | .....
</code></pre>
<p>ie, the frog first takes one step, then two steps, afterwards three
steps, and so on.</p>
<p>And upon starting each move, the frog has the option to change the
direction of its movement (ie, left or right).</p>
<p>All steps within the same move will be made in the same
direction.</p>
<p>The puzzle is to figure out whether it is possible for the frog to
come back to the position from where it started by the time it finishes
making its 10th move.</p>
<h2 id="formulating">Formulating</h2>
<p>We need to find if it's possible for the frog to return to its
starting position in 10 moves.</p>
<p>We could think of the starting position as <code>0</code>, leftward
movements as negative numbers and rightward movements as positive
numbers whose value is the number of steps taken in that move.</p>
<p>Sort of like:</p>
<pre><code>
negative         positive
&lt;---------  0  ---------&gt;
left                right

</code></pre>
<p>Then our puzzle reduces to checking if an arithmetic expression's
value is zero.</p>
<p>For example, if the frog moved like</p>
<pre><code>1-Left, 2-Right, 3-Left 
</code></pre>
<p>we could represent the movements with the following arithmetic
expression:</p>
<pre><code>-1 + 2 - 3
</code></pre>
<h2 id="a-few-sample-movements">A few sample movements</h2>
<p>Before going into the actual puzzle, where the number of movements
(let's call that move count) is 10, let's have a casual glance at a few
examples where the frog can actually return to its starting
location.</p>
<pre><code>|  Move | Move                    |
| count | sequence                |
|-------+-------------------------|
|     3 | +1 +2 -3                |
|     3 | -1 -2 +3                |
|     4 | +1 -2 -3 +4             |
|     7 | -1 -2 +3 +4 -5 -6 +7    |
|     8 | +1 -2 -3 +4 +5 -6 -7 +8 |
|     8 | +1 +2 +3 +4 -5 -6 -7 +8 |
</code></pre>
<p>The positive numbers represent rightward movement and the negative
numbers indicate leftward movement.</p>
<p>The sum of the numbers in each case is zero, meaning that the frog
can return to its starting position if following one of these paths.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>The frog moves 10 times. For move number <code>n</code>, it takes
<code>n</code> steps. And it has the option to change movement direction
at the beginning of each move.</p>
<p>So we could represent the movements like:</p>
<pre><code>1 Â± 2 Â± 3 Â± 4 Â± 5 Â± 6 Â± 7 Â± 8 Â± 9 Â± 10
</code></pre>
<p>We need to know if this arithmetic expression can turn out to be
zero.</p>
<p>In this expression, there are 5 even numbers and 5 odd numbers.</p>
<pre><code>| Odd  | 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 |  9 |
|------+---+---+---+---+----|
| Even | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |
</code></pre>
<p>Let's focus on just the even numbers.</p>
<pre><code>2  4  6  8  10
</code></pre>
<p>We know that addition or subtraction performed between two even
numbers will always result in an even number.</p>
<pre><code>even + even = even
even - even = even
</code></pre>
<p>Like:</p>
<pre><code>4 + 2 = 6
4 - 2 = 2
</code></pre>
<p>ie, no matter whether we use addition or subtraction between these 5
even numbers, it will end up being an even number itself.</p>
<pre><code>2  Â±  4  Â±  6  Â±  8  Â±  10
|     |     |     |      |
+--+--+     +--+--+      |
   |           |         |
  even   Â±    even       |
   |           |         |
   +-----+-----+         |
         |               |
        even      Â±      |
         |               |
         +--------+------+
                  |
                 even
</code></pre>
<p>So the operations on the even numbers result in an even number.</p>
<p>Now, consider the odd numbers.</p>
<p>We know that</p>
<pre><code>odd - odd = even
odd + odd = even
</code></pre>
<p>As in:</p>
<pre><code>3 - 5 = -2
3 + 5 = 8
</code></pre>
<p>In our case, we have 5 odd numbers.</p>
<pre><code>1  3  5  7  9
</code></pre>
<p>Let's group the odd numbers into pairs.</p>
<p>This leaves one of the odd numbers without a pair. Let it be
<code>9</code>.</p>
<pre><code>1  3    5  7    9
|  |    |  |            
+--+    +--+            
</code></pre>
<p>The addition/subtraction operations done on each odd number pair will
result in an even number.</p>
<pre><code>1  Â±  3  Â±  5  Â±  7  Â±  9
|     |     |     |     |
+--+--+     +--+--+     |
   |           |        | 
  even   Â±    even      |
   |           |        |
   +-----+-----+        |
         |              |
        even     Â±     odd
</code></pre>
<p>Which results in an even number and an odd number.</p>
<p>Recall that we got another even number, which is the contribution of
the 5 even numbers that we had considered earlier.</p>
<p>So we are left with 2 even numbers and an odd number.</p>
<pre><code>even    Â±    even    Â±    odd
 |            |
 +------+-----+
        |
       even
</code></pre>
<p>Addition/subtraction done on the two even numbers will result in an
even number.</p>
<p>And we are left with an even number and an odd number.</p>
<pre><code>even    Â±    odd
</code></pre>
<p>We know that:</p>
<pre><code>even + odd = odd
even - odd = odd
</code></pre>
<p>As in:</p>
<pre><code>4 + 5 = 9
4 - 5 = -1
</code></pre>
<p>ie, addition/subtraction done between an even and odd number is going
to result in an odd number.</p>
<p>This means that the result of:</p>
<pre><code>1 Â± 2 Â± 3 Â± 4 Â± 5 Â± 6 Â± 7 Â± 8 Â± 9 Â± 10
</code></pre>
<p>is an odd number.</p>
<p>Since <code>0</code> is not odd, the result cannot be
<code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the frog cannot return to its initial location by the time
it finishes moving for the 10th time.</p>

<h2 id="addendum">Addendum</h2>
<ul>
<li>I wasn't sure if the concept of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_zero">parity</a> (ie,
odd/even) extended to negative numbers. But it seems it does. Parity
talks about integers, which includes negative numbers. Wasn't sure where
to look it up. Ended up taking Wikipedia's word for it.</li>
<li>And zero is <a
href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20559052">considered
even</a>.</li>
