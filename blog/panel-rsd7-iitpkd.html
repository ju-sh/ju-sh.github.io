<div id="content-container">
<p>Research scholars day of IIT Palakkad for the year 2025 (RSD 7) was held between February 21st and 22nd. As part of this event, a panel discussion was held which went over matters related to research life. The panel consisted of professors from IITPKD.</p>
<p>This post is an outline of the thoughts from this session. (Occasionally augmented with my own comments. So this may not be exactly what was discussed.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn not just to answer a question but <strong>to ask the right question</strong>
<ul>
<li>Look at recent papers in your field</li>
<li>Identify the common source of truth that these paper seems to derive from</li>
<li>Start research from that point and figure how to arrive at that source of truth</li>
<li>ie, See what is the <strong>common direction of the papers</strong> being published and try to arrive at the source</li>
<li>Remark: Hitchhiker's guide to galaxy quote
<ul>
<li>What is the answer to life, the universe, everything? 42.</li>
<li>Then what is the meaning of the question ??!</li>
<li>ie, before finding the answer, one should have a clear idea of the question.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Number of publications vs quality of research
<ul>
<li>Quality should matter more than quantity</li>
<li>Unfortunately, Quality is not quanitifiable</li>
<li>Difficult for a group of people to rank papers based on quality</li>
<li>Number is the only metric by which can be agreed upon by everyone</li>
<li>For this reason, number of publications is often used to decide who gets promotion, funding, etc.</li>
<li>Quality is not quanitifiable</li>
<li>Suggestion: <strong>Focus on quality, but don't neglect quantity</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>About advisors potentially pushing student to publish review papers
<ul>
<li>Since review papers are much more likely to accumulate citations</li>
<li>Review papers is not original research, but is literature review</li>
<li>Suggestion:
<ul>
<li><strong>Literature review is a critical skill in research</strong></li>
<li>But literature review must lead to new ideas being explored</li>
<li>One shouldn't stick to writing review papers</li>
<li>Like in the case quantity vs quality,</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Literature review
<ul>
<li>You should know the state of art before starting the actual work</li>
<li>Helps avoid duplication of effort</li>
<li>You are likely to gain insights</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finding a research topic
<ul>
<li>Seek something that you are passionate about</li>
<li>Know more about it. Read literature. Talk to people working in that domain.</li>
<li>See how you can advance the state of the art.</li>
<li>See what contribution can you make to make the work of future researchers easier.</li>
<li>Something that others can build on.</li>
<li>ie, <strong>find something that you are passionate about and see how to make that better</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Incremental research vs breakthroughs
<ul>
<li>Most research is incremental in nature</li>
<li>A PhD work usually extends the boundaries of knowledge a little bit</li>
<li>Although breakthrough ideas are nice, that is not for everyone.</li>
<li>In maths, 10 mediocre theorems may be easier to prove than one big theorem</li>
<li>Method used by a panelist to identify a worthwhile proof:
<ul>
<li>Write the proof, keep it away for a few weeks.</li>
<li>By now you probably can't recall the details of the proof.</li>
<li>Come back and read what you wrote earlier.</li>
<li>If you are amazed by the proof, it is great.</li>
<li>Otherwise, it is mediocre.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Importance of research collaboration
<ul>
<li>How to meet people: Attend conferences, summer schools, webinars</li>
<li>Establish connections while attending events
<ul>
<li>Send a mail</li>
<li>If you have a concrete idea to work on, keep at it don't let lie</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Collobrations should be with people whose expertise you can complement</strong>
<ul>
<li>This also allows both parties to better appreciate each other.</li>
<li>Both parties bring something new to the table, thereby achieving something that neither would've been able to achieve alone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Casual conversations sometimes lead to full blown collaborations</li>
<li>Story shared by a panelist: 
<ul>
<li>Panelist published a paper in an interdisciplinary domain with a collaborator</li>
<li>The collaborator and the panelist were members of the mess committe of their institute</li>
<li>While running an errand related to the mess (buying samosas), they had a chat about their areas of research.</li>
<li>This eventually led to a colloboration resulting in a paper.</li>
<li>A professor in the audience remarked that this is another reason why students should consider joining the mess committee. :D</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Suggestions:
<ul>
<li>Talk about your research to anyone who would listen</li>
<li>Ask about others' research and listen to anyone who has the time to talk about their work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Knowing which journal to submit to: 
<ul>
<li>It could help to know the expertise of editors before submitting to journal</li>
<li>Even for good quality submissions, if the reviewer is not familiar with the topic, they could judge it poorly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Role of AI/ML:
<ul>
<li>AI isn't everything, nor is it nothing</li>
<li>It can make positive contributions
<ul>
<li>Eg: Chatgpt is capable of helping people make beamer slides</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These days applications of AIML is being helpful in almost every domains</li>
<li>To know the benefit of applying concepts or output from another field, there should be interdisciplinary communication
<ul>
<li>Eg: Mechanical dept student should talk with CSE/Data science to learn how AIML can help them automate some of their work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disadvantage: Big applications like chatgpt is difficult for normal people to run on their own.
<ul>
<li>Have to depend on vendors who could charge users.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whether it will take away jobs?
<ul>
<li>Probably.</li>
<li>Once computers began to get popular, many jobs vanished</li>
<li>But computers did make life better.</li>
<li>Ideally, people should be capable of adapting to changing environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concern: What if people start depending on AI too much that they 'forget' how to do the things that they come to depend on AI for?
<ul>
<li>Remark by panelist: Similar to a scenario in an Isaac Asimov novel</li>
<li>As in, there are inteliigent machines, but no human knows to build one anymore.</li>
<li>Not an invalid point, I guess.</li>
<li>Use of computers and calculators has made mental arithmetic less necessary.</li>
<li>But people can now possibly use the time spent on mastering mental arithmetic skills to do other work.</li>
<li>The novel: <em>Prelude to Foundation</em> - 1st prequel in the <em>Foundation</em> series</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Example of handling hostile paper reviews
<ul>
<li>Reviews are usually helpful</li>
<li>If a review's tone is hostile, disregard the tone and use the feedback itself if it makes sense.</li>
<li>If the reviewer is being unnecessarily hostile, contact the journal's editor.</li>
<li>Eg: A paper review mentioned that the submitter is arrogant because of the delay in incorporating suggested changes. Even though there was no direct communication between submitter and the reviewer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finish your PhD as soon as possible
<ul>
<li>During a PhD, you will be making much less money that you would if you were in the industry.</li>
<li><strong>Every extra year you take to complete PhD is loss of great amount of money and immense amount of wasted value in terms of time</strong></li>
<li>You do your best work when you are young</li>
<li>Use your youth to do good work and gain experience</li>
<li>When you get old, you are less likely to be energetic, but you can use your experience to help collaborators and still get good work done.</li>
<li>Great insights are derived from past experiences</li>
<li>ie, time is limited. Use it effectively.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>IEEE seems to have banned the world 'novel' from the titles of papers that it publishes
<ul>
<li>Probably due to too many papers using it.</li>
<li>(Couldn't find the source)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Joke?: Review of a 4 page write-up spanned 5 pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just for fun, here's the part from Hitchiker's guide to galaxy (book version) mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>From <em>The hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy</em> by Douglas Adams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in motion," the second man said, "and in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak."</p>
<p>"An awesome prospect, Phouchg," agreed the first man, and Arthur suddenly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles.</p>
<p>"We are the ones who will hear," said Phouchg, "the answer to the great question of Life â€¦!"<br />
"The Universe â€¦!" said Loonquawl.<br />
"And Everything â€¦!"<br />
"Shhh," said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, "I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak!"</p>
<p>There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel.</p>
<p>"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last.<br />
"Er â€¦ Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously, "do you have â€¦ er, that is â€¦"<br />
"An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "Yes. I have."<br />
The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain.<br />
"There really is one?" breathed Phouchg.<br />
"There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought.<br />
"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything?"<br />
"Yes."<br />
Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.<br />
"And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl. "I am."<br />
"Now?"<br />
"Now," said Deep Thought.<br />
They both licked their dry lips.<br />
"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to like it."<br />
"Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!"<br />
"Now?" inquired Deep Thought.<br />
"Yes! Now â€¦"<br />
"Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.<br />
"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought.<br />
"Tell us!"<br />
"Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question â€¦"<br />
"Yes â€¦!"<br />
"Of Life, the Universe and Everything â€¦" said Deep Thought.<br />
"Yes â€¦!"<br />
"Is â€¦" said Deep Thought, and paused.<br />
"Yes â€¦!"<br />
"Is â€¦"<br />
"Yes â€¦!!!â€¦?"<br />
"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.</p>
<p>It was a long time before anyone spoke.<br />
Out of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea of tense expectant faces down in the square outside.</p>
<p>"We're going to get lynched aren't we?" he whispered.<br />
"It was a tough assignment," said Deep Thought mildly.<br />
"Forty-two!" yelled Loonquawl. "Is that all you've got to show for seven and a half million years' work?"<br />
"I checked it very thoroughly," said the computer, "and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is."<br />
"But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!" howled Loonquawl.<br />
"Yes," said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, "but what actually is it?"</p>
<p>A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other.</p>
<p>"Well, you know, it's just Everything â€¦ Everything â€¦" offered Phouchg weakly.<br />
"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you do know what the question actually is, you'll know what the answer means."</p>
