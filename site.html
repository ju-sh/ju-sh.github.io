<p>There are few ASCII art here and there in this site. These are probably best viewed in a terminal emulator.</p>
<p>I used to write content in markdown, but am now using org files for this purpose, after being inspired by the ease with which my masters course advisor was making notes within emacs.</p>
<p>This site began to form shape due in most part to two people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deepu sir</li>
<li>ppk</li>
</ul>
<p>The site is generated with a few scripts (not so easy on the eye, but it gets the job done) which uses a collection of free and open source tools.</p>
<p>Let me use this opportunity to say that the RSS feed is made with mrkup, a library written by myself.</p>
