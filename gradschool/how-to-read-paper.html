<li>Understand details in-depth</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="pass-1-general-idea">Pass 1: General idea</h2>
<p>Useful even for paper that aren't of your research interests but
might still come useful in future.</p>

<p>Read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>

<li>You don't yet know enough to read and understand the paper.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="category">Category</h4>
<p>What kind of a paper is it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of an existing system?</li>
<li>A research prototype description?</li>
<li>A measurement paper?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="context">Context</h4>
<ul>
<li>What papers are related to this one?</li>
<li>What theoretical results was used to analyze the problem?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="correctness">Correctness</h4>
<p>Do the assumptions used look valid?</p>
<p>Because if the assumptions don't hold up, neither would the
results.</p>
<h4 id="contributions">Contributions</h4>
<ul>
<li>What novel results does the paper contribute?</li>
<li>What value does the paper add to the research area?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="clarity">Clarity</h4>
<p>Is the paper written well enough to be clearly understandable?</p>
<p>So that you can know how much work you would need to put in to
analyze it in depth if needed be.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="actions-1">Actions</h3>
<p>Read the paper with greater care but ignore inner details like
proofs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note down:
<ul>
<li>key takeaways</li>
<li>doubts</li>
<li>comments.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Try to 'virtually' reimplement the paper and see how it would turn
out.
<ul>
<li>Make same assumptions as the paper.</li>
<li>Compare your results with stated results.</li>
<li>Thus identify the paper's innovations (and errors, if any).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identify and challenge every assumption in <strong>every</strong>
statement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expected-results-1">Expected results</h3>
