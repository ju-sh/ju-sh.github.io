<p>You depend on your advisor for:</p>
<ul>
<li>guide towards a proper research direction</li>
<li>deciding on realistic long-term and short-term goals</li>
<li>funding (often)
<ul>
<li>TA-ship, scholarship opportunities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>meeting departmental requirements
<ul>
<li>Eg: prepare for quals</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty is ideally also a mentor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help get involved in the community
<ul>
<li>Maybe introduce to others as well</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prepare for life after grad school</li>
<li>Help land internships</li>
</ul>
<p>But also seek out more mentors (helps broaden your view): Other
students, faculty, etc (SIGPLAN-M is a good way to find a mentor)</p>
<hr />
<p>Make sure that your advisor knows what you are working on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update them regularly
<ul>
<li>They may or may not ask for updates, but it's your responsibility to
make sure that advisor is looped in.</li>
<li>Even their casual remarks are likely to be quite helpful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You may or may not have good ideas, but you are unlikely to be able
to take advantage of good ideas if your advisor is not supportive of
your endeavors. Especially when you are dependent on them for
funding.</li>
