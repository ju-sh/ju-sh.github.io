<p>You depend on your advisor for:</p>
<ul>
<li>guide towards a proper research direction</li>
<li>deciding on realistic long-term and short-term goals</li>
<li>funding (often)
<ul>
<li>TA-ship, scholarship opportunities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>meeting departmental requirements
<ul>
<li>Eg: prepare for quals</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty is ideally also a mentor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help get involved in the community
<ul>
<li>Maybe introduce to others as well</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prepare for life after grad school</li>
<li>Help land internships</li>
</ul>
<p>But also seek out more mentors (helps broaden your view): Other
students, faculty, etc (SIGPLAN-M is a good way to find a mentor)</p>
<ul>
<li>Help student set realistic goals</li>
<li>Identify areas where student needs improvement and suggest ways by
which improvement can be achieved</li>
<li>Student should be able to talk freely about academic matters with
the advisor
<ul>
<li>Advisor shouldn't over/under-manage.</li>
<li>Eg: Student shouldn't feel a need to hold back some results from a
productive day so that he can present it as the result from an
unproductive day.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Advisee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand what the advisor expects first.
<ul>
<li>'Seek first to understand, then be understood.'</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You will have to adapt to your guide's preferences. So choose an
advisor whom you want to be like.
<ul>
<li>Finally you are going to be a lot like them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>Make sure that your advisor knows what you are working on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update them regularly
<ul>
<li>They may or may not ask for updates, but it's your responsibility to
make sure that advisor is looped in.</li>
<li>Even their casual remarks are likely to be quite helpful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You may or may not have good ideas, but you are unlikely to be able
to take advantage of good ideas if your advisor is not supportive of
your endeavors. Especially when you are dependent on them for
funding.</li>
</ul>
<p>An ideal advisor</p>
<ul>
<li>help advisee to think in a systematic, critical manner</li>
<li>should guide/advise, not command</li>
<li>shouldn't think of the advisee as free labour</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A thesis director should clearly mention if progress is sufficient or
not and provide detailed feedback. The comments should be positive or
provide constructive criticism in a fair manner, while giving
perspective. Purely negative feedback does not encourage improvement</p>
