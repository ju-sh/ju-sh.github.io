<p>It's not about caring about what others say. It's about being able to
live with yourselves. If your conscience is clear, nothing can break
you. <strong>Be confident</strong>.</p>
<p>Don't let anyone make you think you did something that you haven't.
Find peace within yourself. The kingdom of god is within you. Perception
is reality. Life is simple. All the complications are made by ourselves.
Each one of which can be undone by ourselves.</p>
<p>If others think you are a waste of space, okay, they are free to
think what they wish. Don't loose your confidence in yourselves. Have
faith in thyself.</p>
<p><strong>Believe in yourself</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Don't compare yourselves with somebody else</em>. It leads to
jealousy, hate and anger. None of which can lead to any good in the long
run.// You are what you are. You are unique. Stay unique. <strong>Don't
become someone else. Better yourselves while still being
yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>Believe in yourself. <strong>Focus</strong>.</p>
<p>Maintain a safe distance from toxic relations. Say no if you want to
say no.</p>
<p>Don't give offense to anyone as much as possible.<br />
Don't make enemies for no reason.</p>
<p>Stand up for yourself. But don't be arrogant or rash.<br />
Don't be a woman. Be a man.</p>
<p>Don't do anything that you don't want to do. <strong>If you are doing
something, do it with sincerity</strong>.</p>
<p>Don't fake smiles. Smile only if you mean it.<br />
Smiling too broadly makes you and others lose confidence in you.</p>
<p>Sit properly. <em>Don't slouch</em>.</p>
<p>Try not to walk fast extra fast unless you got to. Walking too fast
leads to increased heart rate which makes you more inclined to get
tense.// Enjoy the walk. Walk at a smooth pace. Don't care about who
come in front or behind you.</p>
<p><em>Be decisive</em>. Don't be ambivalent.</p>
<hr />
<p>No need to convince yourself (or pretend) that you understand
something being discussed if you don't really understand it. Others
might think you an idiot, but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who doesn't ask
a question is a fool for ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn't matter even if you haven't got a question to throw in right
away. No need to yield to a pressure to look like you understood a
concept that you haven't got hold of.</p>
<p>Do what you like doing. You shouldn't be chasing success. Success
should chase you.</p>
<p>Success is like pretty girl in high-school who is used to the
attention all the boys. If you pay attention to her, she will spurn
you.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>It's our choice that show what we truly are.. <em>far more</em> than
our abilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Do what makes you happy.</li>
<li>Do it because you want to do it. Not for money or fame.</li>
<li>Do one thing at a time.</li>
