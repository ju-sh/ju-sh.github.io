<p>Hi! A little bit about me.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>I am a Computer Science masters student with an interest in learning new languages. Both natural and programming languages (thanks to my friends who speak many different languages).</p>
<p>I'm also interested in whatever mathematics that I can understand. Thankfully, I'm at college with a few math students in it. :-)</p>
<p>I like programming languages that favour the functional style, but also use the more popular languages if need calls.</p>
<p>â€”</p>
<p>I discovered type theory and logic in 2021 from my masters course advisor.</p>
<p>I joined thinking I knew something about types but quickly realized that it was something different than what I expected. I had (and still have) a lot to learn, but got captivated by programming language theory in no time. Language features solidly backed by mathematical theories are great for proving program correctness.</p>
<h2 id="plain-text-keyboard-terminal">Plain text, keyboard, terminal</h2>
<p>I like using the terminal and keyboard to interact with computers (preferred editors: emacs and vim, org-mode for notes).</p>
<p>Plain text is the best data format.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain-text email</li>
<li>Plain-text documents</li>
<li>Plain-text table (emacs org-mode helps)</li>
</ul>
<p>Would rather use computer than a phone. That way we wouldn't be pestered with messages when we feel like relaxing.</p>
<p>Email is better than any 'instant-messaging' service or platform. It would be great if people use email more often.</p>
<p>I prefer to do things that will help ordinary citizens rather than helping corporate giants get richer. Hopefully there are funding opportunities that fit this (or am I being naÃ¯ve? ðŸ˜ƒ).</p>
<h2 id="this-site">This site</h2>
<p>I try to keep this site minimalistic and stick to just text to make it as light-weight as possible.</p>
<p>Being able to view web pages on a terminal-only browser in addition to the normal ones is a nice feeling.</p>
<p>No javascript or tracking. :)</p>
<p>This site is static and is built with a handful of scripts that I put together. It primarily relies on org-mode and pandoc to generate the web-pages. RSS/Atom feeds are built with a <a href="https://github.com/ju-sh/mrkup">small python package</a> that I once made.</p>
<p>Also checkout my blog and tell me what you think.</p>
<p>Corrections are always appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="a-quote">A quote</h2>
<p>Here is a quote that I found online (source unknown. Tell me if you know where it's from):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is quite simple - nothing that is meant for you will ever get away.</em></p>
<p><em>Love deeply, and without the need to possess or own;</em></p>
<p><em>let beautiful connections pass through you without attachment,</em></p>
<p><em>slam your heart into the people and the places and the things that ignite something deep inside of your soul,</em></p>
<p><em>and I promise, I promise - the right things will stay.</em><br />
<em>You will never lose what is for you.</em><br />
<em>Please donâ€™t ever forget that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
