<p>Hi! A little bit about me.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>I am a Computer Science student with an interest in learning new
languages. Both natural and programming languages (thanks to my friends
who speak many different languages).</p>
<p>I'm also interested in whatever mathematics that I can understand.
Thankfully, I'm at college with a few math students in it. :-)</p>
<p>I like functional languages, Python and am also developing a fondness
for functional programming languages (thanks to my teachers).</p>
<h2 id="plain-text-keyboard-terminal">Plain text, keyboard,
terminal</h2>
<p>I like using the terminal and keyboard to interact with
computers.</p>
<p>I like both emacs and vim. Both have its own advantages. Emacs can do
anything and everything, whereas vi/vim is found anywhere and
everywhere. Emacs org mode is great.</p>
<p>Plain text is the best data format.</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain-text email</li>
<li>Plain-text documents</li>
<li>Plain-text table (emacs org-mode can help)</li>
</ul>
<p>Would rather use computer than a phone. That way we wouldn't be
pestered with messages when we feel like relaxing.</p>
<p>Email is better than any 'instant-messaging' service or platform. It
would be great if people use email more often.</p>
<p>I prefer to do things that will help ordinary citizens rather than
helping corporate giants get richer. Hopefully there are funding
opportunities that fit this (or am I being naÃ¯ve? ðŸ˜ƒ).</p>
<hr />
<p>I discovered type theory and logic in 2021 from my masters course
advisor.</p>
<p>I joined thinking I knew something about types but quickly realized
that it was something different than what I expected. I had (and still
have) a lot to learn. But got familiar with a lot already.</p>
<h2 id="this-site">This site</h2>
<p>I try to keep this site minimalistic and stick to just text to make
it as light-weight as possible.</p>
<p>No javascript or tracking. :)</p>
<p>Also checkout my blog and tell me what you think.</p>
<p>Corrections are always appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="a-quote">A quote</h2>
<p>Here is a quote that I found online (source unknown. Tell me if you
know where it's from):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/It is quite simple - nothing that is meant for you will ever get
away.<br />
Love deeply, and without the need to possess or own;/<br />
/let beautiful connections pass through you without attachment,<br />
slam your heart into the people and the places and the things that
ignite something deep inside of your soul,/<br />
<em>and I promise, I promise - the right things will stay.<br />
You will never lose what is for you.</em></p>
<p><em>Please donâ€™t ever forget that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
