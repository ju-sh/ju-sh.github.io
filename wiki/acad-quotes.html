<blockquote>
<p>The aim of theory really is, to a great extent, that of systematically organizing past experience in such a way that the next generation, our students and their students and so on, will be able to absorb the essential aspects in as painless a way as possible, and this is the only way in which you can go on cumulatively building up any kind of scientific activity without eventually coming to a dead end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my experience, the most important character trait in research is not intelligence, but self-discipline. Brilliance helps, but it's not necessary. <strong>Success in grad school is 20% luck, 20% intelligence and 50% hard work.</strong> I never figured out what the remaining 10% is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you only want to go to a top grad school, then you're going to grad school for the wrong reason</strong>, and the odds of you getting in are low. You should go to grad school because you want to do research, and you don't need to go to a "top" school for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In chapter II, 51 of Don Quixote, Miguel de Cervantes describes a curious case presented to Sancho Panza as the governor of the island Barataria. There was a river, a bridge, a gallows - and a law. According to the law, everyone crossing the bridge must first tell under oath where he is going. If he is truthful, he may pass freely, but if he lies, he will be hanged on the gallows. Now, a man is brought to Sancho after having taken the oath that he was going to be hanged on the gallows. The judges had been unable to solve the case, for if he was hanged, he had spoken the truth and thus should not have been hanged. And if he was not hanged, he lied, and thus should have been hanged.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>in what sense a person who "swears that he will break his oath" can keep his oath</p>

<li><p>Beware of the bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it. - Donald Knuth</p></li>
<li><p>I promise I don't care whether or not you have publications when you apply to work with me on a PhD… I do care about whether you are <strong>reading the existing literature and experimenting with stuff</strong> <strong>independently</strong>. Those qualities are much more predictive for me than prior publications. <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@jonmsterling/112263492455078177">ʳ</a> - Jon Sterling</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>When I was a child, I was told that Santa Claus came in through the chimney, and that computers were programmed in binary code. Since then, I have learned that programming is better done in higher-level languages, more abstract and more expressive.</strong> I have also learned that programmers sometimes make errors, and therefore that advanced programming languages should not only convey the programmer’s thoughts, but also allow the automatic checking for certain inconsistencies in programs</p>
