<li>A PhD joke:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a ruinous misconception that a Ph.D. must be smart.</p>
<p>This can't be true.</p>
<p>A smart person would know better than to get a Ph.D.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Greg Morrisett about Robert Harpert at CMU:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Towards the end of my graduate career, I had figured something out
and was excited to show Bob. I went up to his office but couldn’t find
him. In fact, he disappeared for a whole week. (I later found out he was
trying to solve all of the puzzles in the "Myst" CD-ROM game that was
all the rage back then.) When I finally tracked him down, I started
writing on the white board and got about half-way through explaining
whatever it was that so excited me. Bob kept interrupting me with
questions. I got so frustrated that I finally just threw the white board
marker at him and yelled at him to “Shut up!” At that point, he leaned
back in his chair, smiled, and said, "Now you’re ready to graduate."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tom Murphy VII about Robert Harper:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe Bob is the smartest person I’ve met, although to be polite
I should exclude anyone currently reading this (can’t exclude Bob,
though, or the statement is ill-formed).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From <em>The story of math</em> - Part 4</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There's kind of a rule in seminars that first it's for everyone.
Second is for the experts, and the last is just for the lecturer.</p>

<p>The real monad is the friends that we made along the way.</p>

<ul>
<li>Found online (not yet sure what it means, but it looked
clever):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>git gets easier once you get the basic idea that branches are
homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of a Hilbert space.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Found online (not complete sure of the implications, but looked
clever):</li>

<blockquote>
<p>If you choose an answer to this question at random, what is the
chance that you will be correct:<br />
- A: 25%<br />
- B: 0%<br />
- C: 50%<br />
- D: 25%</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mathematician and engineer are set on a line one meter away from a
million dollars.</p>
<p>Judge says "every minute, you are able to half the distance to
money"</p>
<p>Mathematician immediately gives up, but the engineer takes the first
step. Mathematician tells him "why do you bother? You will never be able
to reach it, you can't halve to zero"</p>
<p>Engineer answers "yes, but at some point I will be close enough for
practical use"</p>

<li>There are 10 kinds of people in the world, those that understand
binary, those that don't, and those that didn't expect this joke to be
in ternary. - A youtube comment</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Found in a chat group oriented towards category theory:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>E1: Why is this chat empty? Category theory is so good!<br />
E2: Just make an incorrect statement or a comparison that lacks complete
scope or nuance, and it will spring to life.<br />
E3: A functor is a container of values, right?<br />
E4: Are you taking E2's advice?</p>

<p>Q: What do you get if you cross a mosquito with a mountain
climber?<br />
A: Nothing!<br />
Because you can't cross a vector with a scalar.</p>

Mountain climber scales mountains.)</p>

<p>Reading quite some #Haskell code, I realize that Haskellers don't
care about anything but money. I mean, the source is full of

even doing anything useful, wanted to <code>first (add 1000) $</code>.
Outrageous.</p>

<pre><code>Dear Professor Lefschetz:

          This is to recommend Mr. John F. Nash, Jr.
who has applied for entrance to the graduate college
at Princeton.

          Mr. Nash is nineteen years old and is 
graduating from Carnegie Tech in June.  He is a
mathematical genius.

                      Yours sincerely,
