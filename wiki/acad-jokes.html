<li>A PhD joke:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a ruinous misconception that a Ph.D. must be smart.</p>
<p>This can't be true.</p>
<p>A smart person would know better than to get a Ph.D.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Greg Morrisett about Robert Harpert at CMU:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Towards the end of my graduate career, I had figured something out
and was excited to show Bob. I went up to his office but couldn’t find
him. In fact, he disappeared for a whole week. (I later found out he was
trying to solve all of the puzzles in the "Myst" CD-ROM game that was
all the rage back then.) When I finally tracked him down, I started
writing on the white board and got about half-way through explaining
whatever it was that so excited me. Bob kept interrupting me with
questions. I got so frustrated that I finally just threw the white board
marker at him and yelled at him to “Shut up!” At that point, he leaned
back in his chair, smiled, and said, "Now you’re ready to graduate."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tom Murphy VII about Robert Harper:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe Bob is the smartest person I’ve met, although to be polite
I should exclude anyone currently reading this (can’t exclude Bob,
though, or the statement is ill-formed).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From <em>The story of math</em> - Part 4</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There's kind of a rule in seminars that first it's for everyone.
Second is for the experts, and the last is just for the lecturer.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Found from <a

(I guess it is referring to the end result?):</li>

<p>The real monad is the friends that we made along the way.</p>
