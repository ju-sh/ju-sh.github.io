<p>About the search for finding a research topic after abandoing working on Klee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every single day, I tried reading several computer science research papers and taking notes to get inspired to think of my own creative ideas. <strong>But without proper guidance or context, I ended up wasting a lot of time and not extracting any meaningful insights from my readings.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Need to structure your time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there was no boss to look over my shoulder day to day, so I let my mind roam free <strong>without any structure in my life</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>You need the right things at the right time..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having full intellectual freedom was actually a curse, since I was not yet prepared to handle it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facing reality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I no longer had lofty dreams of becoming a tenured professor: I just wanted to figure out some way to eventually graduate.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>About not having anyone to talk to about your problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My friends who were not in Ph.D. programs thought that I was merely "in school" and taking classes like a regular student. And the few friends I had made in my department were equally depressed with their own first-year Ph.D. struggles - most notably, the shock of being thrown head-first into challenging, open-ended research problems without the power to affect the high-level direction of their assigned projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Another reality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we were, talented young computer scientists voluntarily working on tasks that were both excruciatingly difficult and seemingly pointless, all while earning one-fourth as much salary as our friends in the corporate working world.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In retrospect, going solo so early during grad school was a terrible decision. … … The wiser course of action during those weeks <strong>would have been to talk to Dawson more frequently, and to actively seek out collaborations with other professors or senior students</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>A margin note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Learning to send succinct and effective professional emails</strong> has benefited my career tremendously.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>As an advisor, it’s hard to provide detailed guidance when you’re not getting your hands dirty with the project code, since you don’t have a good feel for its idiosyncratic technical details</strong>. That’s why I still try to stay as "close to the grind" as time permits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="y2">Y2</h2>
<p>So true.. Some profs use students merely as underpaid labourers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's going to be really hard for me to push ahead with a Ph.D. project <strong>unless I feel a strong sense of ownership and enthusiasm about it</strong>, so I really want to work to find the intersection of what I feel passionate about and what is actually deemed ‘research-worthy’ by professors and the greater academic community.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Choose your advisor accordingly, I guess..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a sense that this project might be risky because it was not within his main areas of expertise or interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Advise given to author by old profs at MIT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Be proactive in talking with professors to find research topics that are mutually interesting, and no matter what, don’t just hole up in isolation.*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I wish my MS advisor had told me something similar. In fact, he said quite the opposite…)</p>
<hr />
<p>About the importance of thinking about experiments to validate a research idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the importance of the third point - <strong>thinking in terms of experiments when proposing research project ideas</strong>. Professors are motivated by having their names appear on published papers, and <strong>computer science conference papers usually need strong experiments to get accepted for publication</strong>. Thus, it’s crucial to think about experiment design at project inception time.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>About author's efforts to find research subjects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In retrospect, I’m not surprised that my workplace shadowing attempts failed, since <strong>I had absolutely nothing to offer these professional programmers; I would just be disrupting their workday</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Need to offer something in return is a factor in Scott deciding to help the author in the initial days too..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I had a fellowship, Scott didn’t need to fund me from his grants, so there was no real downside for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Was the author sour that Scott's student Joel became first author of the HCI paper even though the idea was that of the author's….?</p>
<hr />
<p>It's best to have a log of your research like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I worked, I kept a meticulous log of my experimental progress in a research lab notebook, noting which trials did and did not work.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>This!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The underlying cause of our publication troubles was that we were not "insiders" in the empirical software measurement subfield to which our project belonged. At the time Dawson and I started working in this sub-field, teams of researchers from dozens of universities and corporate research labs were already doing similar work. Dawson and I were severely outgunned by the competition, which consisted of professors and research scientists specializing in empirical software measurement who were advising armies of Ph.D. students to do the heavy number crunching. … Most importantly, they frequently served on program committees and as external reviewers for the relevant conferences, so they knew exactly what it took to write publishable papers in this subfield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something that my MS advisor lacked and had no interest in.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Dawson was already tenured and had only a mild side interest in this topic. The lesson here is that <strong>it’s very hard to publish on a topic if your advisor isn't also obsessively thinking about it</strong>, since you’re directly competing against other students whose advisors are obsessively thinking about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In the cutthroat world of academic publishing, simply being passionate about a topic is nowhere near sucient for success; <strong>one must be well-versed in the preferences of senior colleagues in a particular subfield who are serving as paper reviewers</strong>. … … Scott could leverage his experience to present our project’s motivations and findings <strong>in a way that was the most palatable to those sorts of reviewers</strong>, thereby raising our paper’s chances of acceptance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot re-emphasize this point enough times: <strong>Properly calibrating your pitch to the academic sub-community you’re targeting is crucial for getting a paper accepted</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So look for a PhD advisor who has experience publishing at confs in the area of your interest.</p>
<h2 id="y3">Y3</h2>
<p>About Klee's configuration options. This is a downside when working on something made by others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>since it was a research prototype hacked together by students, the behaviors of most of those options were not clearly documented. As a result, I wasted a lot of time due to misunderstanding the subtle interactions between options as I was adjusting them.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>About the Post-doc being busy with faculty job apps and advisor being easy-going because of tenure, leaving author without a paper despite his efforts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can see why this project was likely to fail <strong>because of misaligned incentives</strong>. … … the importance of deeply understanding <strong>the motivations and incentives of one’s potential collaborators</strong> before working with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This project fizzled due to a combination of <strong>my own lack of technical expertise</strong> and <strong>insucient mentorship</strong> from senior colleagues.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>About struggles to stay motivated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it was hard to keep myself motivated when I didn’t see noticeable daily progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>A horror story.. What on earth was their advisor doing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One of those students dropped out of the Ph.D. program after over nine years in the department and zero publications</strong>, and the other one graduated after nine years and only one Klee-related publication. That publication addressed the same search algorithm problem that I originally attempted. It took that student five years to publish that paper, which let him graduate.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Almost all the PhD dropouts that the author mention get really good jobs. Perks of being at Stanford, I guess.</p>
<hr />
<p>About Dawson finally publishing paper with a student on a specific topic. After attempts by 4 students. 2 of whom quit PhD life itself and the author who quit their lab.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From an individual student’s perspective, the odds of success were low. <strong>From a professor’s perspective, though, Klee-UC was a rousing success!</strong> Since Dawson had tenure, his job was never in danger. In fact, one of the purposes of tenure is to allow professors to take risks by attempting bolder project ideas. However, the dark side of this privilege is that <strong>professors will often assign students to grind on risky projects with low success rates</strong>. And the <strong>students often can’t refuse</strong>, since they are funded by their advisors’ grants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems nasty behaviour of profs. They shouldn't be toying with the careers of the students. This should be stopped. But who is there to check them..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As long as the original vision is realized and published, then the project is considered a success. The professor is happy, the university department is happy, the grant funding agency is happy, and the final surviving set of students is happy. But <strong>what about the student casualties along the way?</strong> A tenured professor can survive several years’ worth of failures, but a Ph.D. student’s fledgling career—and psychological health—will likely be ruined by such a chain of disappointments.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The groundbreaking initial Klee work had already been done; all that remained were follow-up incremental enhancements</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Because Dawson had not been actively publishing in recent years, he no longer knew all of the rhetorical tricks, newfangled buzzwords, and marketing-related contortions required to satisfy reviewers and get his papers accepted into top-tier conferences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tenured prof is more likely to be a lazy prof…</p>
<h2 id="intermission">Intermission</h2>
<p>I wanna attend such programmes too!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the longest-lasting impact of an MSR internship is the friendships we all made</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Author on how he ended up at MSR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the importance of combining concrete achievements with professional connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>About online portal of companies inviting internships.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Online submission forms are black holes. Anything is better than blindly submitting online. … … Most of my fellow interns also got their jobs through connections, although usually their advisors made a direct recommendation to a relevant MSR colleague. … … I learned about the <strong>importance of being endorsed by an influential person; simply doing good work isn’t enough to get noticed in a hyper-competitive field</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's best to have some connection who can reel you in.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Having a published paper was crucial here, since I could point Tom to a vetted document instead of just rambling about my idle speculations on this topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I have no paper. But I could at least write down my thoughts in an organized fashion.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>It’s important not to directly seek out influential people to schmooze with, since that rarely works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead seek people whose work you are interested in. Not just because they are famous.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a feature of an ideal advisor, I suppose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although daily check-ups could potentially be stressful, I actually found them immensely helpful since Tom <strong>wasn’t intimidating or judgmental at all</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>combination of a well-defined, short-term goal and continual helpful feedback</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Perhaps turning off work after hours is not a bad idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no possible way to take my work home with me since the data was available only within Microsoft, so I just chilled every evening and had fun without worrying about whether I ought to be working more; back at school, I constantly worried about whether I was working enough since I could potentially be working during all waking moments.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Perks of being an 'inside' in the research field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tom was able to <strong>deftly frame our contributions in the context of related work, argue for why our results were novel and significant</strong>, and get our paper as polished as possible</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="y4">Y4</h2>
<p>About his IncPy idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within a few days, I had sketched out an initial project plan, which included arguments for <strong>why IncPy was unique, innovative, and research-worthy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This is very important to do before diving in and starting to code</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Author made use of his time at MSR to pitch his IncPy idea and polish it from their feedback. How could he be confident that one of them wouldn't steal the idea?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>I also had some friends arrange for me to give talks on IncPy—which was only a half- baked idea at the time—at their lab group meetings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting feedback. And the importance of network.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Expertise opens the door to new creative outlets</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Workshop papers are meant to disseminate early ideas and are not scrutinized as rigorously as conference papers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why was my MS advisor angry about a submission to a workshop?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t have gotten lucky if I hadn’t followed my curiosity at that moment. Part of luck is always keeping your eyes open for new opportunities while simultaneously focusing enough to make consistent progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>I discovered that this strategy of finding and setting short-term deadlines for myself would work wonders in keeping me focused throughout the rest of my Ph.D. years. Without self-imposed deadlines, it becomes easy to fall into a rut and succumb to chronic procrastination</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The biggest difference between a workshop and a conference paper is that a conference paper must have a convincing experimental evaluation that shows the effectiveness of the tool or technique being described in the paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Author when hunting for programs and users for case studies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned to be part-salesman and part-beggar,</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>I understood why almost no research pro- totype tools get successfully deployed. The underlying reason is that people don’t want to try a new tool unless they can instantly see major benefits without any drawbacks;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>One benefit of presenting a talk on a paper is that people can chat with you about it afterward, which can lead to serendipity.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Author mentions many cold-email that turned out to play pivotal roles in his career.</p>
<hr />
<p>Author must have taken the snag of IncPy not being compatible with python extensions very well. He ended up getting inspired to start another project because of that experience.</p>
<hr />
<p>About author getting no response when he adapted IncPy to work with third party extensions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the user gets a bad first impression, then it’s over! … … I emailed the UC Berkeley neuroscientists again to ask for a second chance, but I got no response. I had one shot, and I blew it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="y5">Y5</h2>
<p>Author has had a good deal of paper rejections.</p>
<hr />
<p>Author's advisor when asked what it would take for the author to graduate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He did have one concrete suggestion, though: Another dissertation-worthy project would be for me to combine my interest in Python with Klee-like ideas that he loved in order to create an automated bug-finding tool for Python programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Profs just pushing their own agenda… sheesh..</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Getting started was the hardest part, but thankfully my MSR internship provided the initial spark of inspiration for IncPy.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Usual scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a researcher, it’s foolish to expect people to use your prototypes as though they were real products; if your ideas are good, then professional engineers might adapt them into their company’s future products.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Importance of the pitch used to frame a paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ut miraculously, Jeff's technical writing and argument framing skills turned that near defeat into a surprise victory. The reviewers loved how we honestly acknowledged the failures of our evaluation and extracted valuable in- sights from them. Without a doubt, our paper would have never been accepted if not for Jeff's rhetorical expertise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dbt-horror-scenario">DBT: Horror scenario</h2>
<p>What if your advisor takes your ideas and lets someone else in the group publish with it becasue they were capable of finishing the work faster than you?</p>
