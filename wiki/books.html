<p>(All numbers are in binary.)</p>
<p>Given a number: z = zₘ₊ₙ;zₘ₊ₙ₋₁;….;z₂;z₁</p>
<p>are there two numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>a = zₙ;zₘ₊ₙ₋₁;….;z₂;z₁</li>
<li>b = zₘ;zₘ₊ₙ₋₁;….;z₂;z₁</li>
</ul>
<p>such that a*b = z</p>

<h2 id="fooled">Fooled?</h2>
<p>Was I fooled?</p>
<p>Well it depends on how you look at it, right?</p>
<p>I'm inclined to think that the younger brother was inded fooled
because the elder brother fooled the younger brother by fooling him into
thinking that he would be fooled that day.</p>
<p>So the fooling really did happen, didn't it?</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Was I lying?</p>
<p>Well, he <em>was</em> lying at the time of the interview since he
really did object to telling lies to sell more products at the time and
yet answered he didn't object to lying. But the utterance of that lie
could have brought about some change in his mind which would make it
easier to lie afterwards to the prospective customers, which could
possible have been the aim of the interviewer himself.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Truth and lies</p>
<p>I agree with the author. One cannot lie without knowing that he is
lying. Because for one to lie, he must be saying something that goes
against what <u>he</u> believes to be the truth. And what <u>he</u>
believes as the truth may not be the truth.</p>
<p>And as a side note, I guess it is possible that what one person
considers as the truth may not be what another person considers to be
the truth. What the first person considers to be the truth may even be
something that another person considers to be a lie. There may be
dependency on a definition of <u>truth</u> itself that may change based
on perspective.</p>

<p>Chimpanzee experiment</p>
<p>How can we say that the chimpanzee was dissimulating?</p>
<p>Couldn't he have been asking for the help of the experimenter by
tugging on his sleeve? The chimpanzee need not have been fooling the
experimenter. Chimpanzee could just have been asking the experimenter to
stand under the banana so that the former can climb on top of the
experimenter to get hold of the banana. Isn't that a possibility?</p>

<p>Man in portrait:</p>
<p>The man in the portrait is the son of the man looking at the
portrait. (Could only figure it out with the hint. :-D)</p>

<p>24 red socks and 24 blue socks:</p>
<p>3? Since the minimum value is asked?</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Irresistible cannonball and immovable post:</p>
<p>Sounds like a contradiction. Either the irresistibility of the
cannonball fails or the immovability of the post fails.</p>
