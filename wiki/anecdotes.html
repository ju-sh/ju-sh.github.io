<p>Stories that I cooked up or found online that are of potential use in explaining PL concepts.</p>
<h2 id="infinite-loop-can-prove-any-theorems">Infinite loop can prove any theorems</h2>
<p>In the cafeteria, often the size/quantity of food served would be less than what we are paying for.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we ask the people serving the food, they will say the manager told them to serve only that much.</li>
<li>If we ask the manager, he would blame the people serving the food saying they are new and are still learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>To whom is the blame assigned in effect? No-one. Everyone gets scot-free.</p>
<p>Proven by infinite loop!</p>

<pre><code>Guy1: Who are you?
Guy2: (Gesturing to the one beside him) I&#39;m his friend.
Guy1: Who is he?
Guy2: He&#39;s my friend.
</code></pre>
<p>You don't get an answer. It's a loop. Still it <em>looks</em> sound.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Here's another one:</p>
<pre class="coq"><code>Fixpoint absurdity : False := absurdity.
</code></pre>
<p><code>absurdity</code> is kind of appealing to itself to say that it's correct.</p>
<p>Of course, coq doesn't allow this.</p>

<pre><code>Mother (opening the refridgerator): Oh, we are running low on milk.
Mother (to her son): Go to the store for me, would you?
</code></pre>
<p>Son understands that his mother means for him to go to the grocery shop and buy a few packets of milk. That's because he is a human.</p>
<p>If the son was a machine was a machine name SON instead of a human, it could've been interpreted differently.</p>
<p>SON could've</p>
<ul>
<li>gone upto the grocery store's doorstep (so that we can't say that it didn't go to the shop) and come back empty handed (or never came back at all).</li>
<li>gone to a jewellery store and came back
<ul>
<li>because Mother didn't say what store</li>
</ul></li>
<li>actually gone to the grocery shop, bought the milk</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Go to the grocery store, buy 2 packets of milk, come back home and put the milk packets in the refridgerator.
</code></pre>
<p>The level of detail depends on the guarantees that we want.</p>
<p>Even at this point, nothing stops SON from taking the milk back out from the refridgerator right after keeping it inside (and thus fulfilling the contract).</p>
<p>—</p>
<h3 id="ambiguity">Ambiguity</h3>
<p>Within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>But what is reasonable?</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<p>Python string formatting mini-language is given by a sort of grammar: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec">https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec</a></p>
<pre><code>format_spec     ::=  [[fill]align][sign][&quot;z&quot;][&quot;#&quot;][&quot;0&quot;][width][grouping_option][&quot;.&quot; precision][type]
fill            ::=  &lt;any character&gt;
align           ::=  &quot;&lt;&quot; | &quot;&gt;&quot; | &quot;=&quot; | &quot;^&quot;
sign            ::=  &quot;+&quot; | &quot;-&quot; | &quot; &quot;
width           ::=  digit+
grouping_option ::=  &quot;_&quot; | &quot;,&quot;
precision       ::=  digit+
type            ::=  &quot;b&quot; | &quot;c&quot; | &quot;d&quot; | &quot;e&quot; | &quot;E&quot; | &quot;f&quot; | &quot;F&quot; | &quot;g&quot; | &quot;G&quot; | &quot;n&quot; | &quot;o&quot; | &quot;s&quot; | &quot;x&quot; | &quot;X&quot; | &quot;%&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>But there's more to it.</p>
<p>If we follow this grammar, we can have</p>
<pre><code>.precision d
</code></pre>
<p>which isn't actually possible in Python because precision cannot be used if type is <code>int</code>.</p>
<h2 id="bindings-in-real-life">Bindings in real life</h2>
<p>In natural languages.</p>
<pre><code>It&#39;s here.
</code></pre>
<p>is like</p>
<pre><code>λ &#39;it. λ &#39;here. =&gt; &#39;it is &#39;here
</code></pre>
<h2 id="difference-between-weak-and-strong-until-in-ltl">Difference between weak and strong until in LTL</h2>
<p>Consider a speaker is faced with a question that he finds difficult to answer. He tell the person who asked the question that he'll answer the question once he finishes the talk.</p>
<p>noanswer U talkover</p>
<p>Suppose the speaker managed his talk such that he finished his talk with no time for question.</p>
<p>Under weak until, the promise is upheld. But not for strong until.</p>
<h2 id="law-of-excluded-middle-in-intuitionistic-logic">Law of excluded middle in Intuitionistic logic</h2>
<p>Two inverted bowls: A and B We are told that there is a marble underneath one of them: A ∨ B From this can we tell which bowl has the marble?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That's where constructive logic differs from classical logic.</p>
<h2 id="gcd">GCD</h2>
<p>My friend and I are drinking tea. I finished my cup. Friend is still drinking. To keep him company, I refill my glass. He finished, but now I'm still drinking, so he refills as well. This goes on.</p>
<p>How many times should I refill my glass till we can both finish our cups at the same time?</p>
<p>Another scenario: There are only ₹101 and ₹11 currency notes. I need to pay exactly ₹100 to my friend. He can return money as well. Is it possible to pay the ₹100 with just ₹101 and ₹11 notes?</p>
<h2 id="complete-but-vacuous-spec">Complete but vacuous spec</h2>
<p>Apparently a sign at a diner:</p>
<pre><code>  Kids eat free

<h2 id="language-in-which-you-cant-lie">Language in which you can't lie</h2>
<p>(Got this thought from the wikipedia page for the <em>Eragon</em> books.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Define what truth is, using types.</li>
<li>Then the resulting language will be a language in which it is impossible to lie.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="paradoxes">Paradoxes</h2>
