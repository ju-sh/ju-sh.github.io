<p>Talk by Benjamin Pierce.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper's presentation should be such that a first year PhD student
must be able to understand it.</li>
<li>Abstract is like an advertisement of the paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before a presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read out your work aloud to yourself.
<ul>
<li>Gives you a different perspective than reading.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find friends to read out to.</li>
<li>Ask related people. Including 'competition'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Iterate. Have many passes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good writing is rewriting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most writers polish draft after draft.</p>
<ul>
<li>Steven Pinker</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From <em>Strunk and White, Elements of style</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vigorous writing is concise. <strong>A sentence should contain no
unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences</strong>, for
the same reason that a drawing should contain no unnecessary lines and a
machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all
his sentences short or that he avoid all details and treat his subjects
in outline, <strong>but that every word tell</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every word has to be there for a reason. Compress to remove
unnecessary words.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>In this section, we describe some
of the highlights of the research
area. We discuss some of the most
significant, elegant and useful
algorithms, and some corresponding
lower bound results.
</code></pre>
<p>This is part of an example from '<em>Handout on unnecessary
prose</em> - Leslie Lamport, in <em>Mathematical writing</em>.<a

<a
href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf">²</a></p>
<p>But the following is from it though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leslie was once told: "<strong>Judge an artist not by the quality of
what is framed and hanging on the walls, but by the quality of what's in
the wastebasket.</strong>" Similarly, Leslie thinks that we should be
judged on the "best thing that we have done that we decided not to
publish."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learn from other writers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All great writers imitate (learn from) other great writers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About tools like grammarly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't let them be a clutch.</li>
<li>You should be the one to make the decisions.</li>
<li>The tool should just be double checking.</li>
</ul>

<p>client and server types are duals of each other.</p>

<li>Linear type: single use values

<li>Values that can't be reused</li>
<li>Like linear logic in that sense, I guess.</li>

<ul>
<li>Why PhD?</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intersection of own interests + general interest of community</li>
<li>First advisor, then branched out via collaborations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is better? Find a problem and figure out a way to solve it? Or
find a solution and find a problem for it? Any thoughts?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grad school is what <em>you</em> make of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you choose your own path. <strong>Take initiative.</strong></p>
<p>Amount of time available for research will only go down. Make good
use of PhD time. And you become less young as time goes on.</p>
<h2 id="how-not-to-give-a-great-research-talk">How not to give a great
research talk</h2>
<p>What to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>No need of outline slides
<ul>
<li>∵ it's like a forward reference.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No need to explan <em>all</em> details.
<ul>
<li>Choose important aspects only.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explain what you did.
<ul>
<li>But not <em>everything</em> you did.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use examples.</li>
<li>Same beamer theme is tiresome.
<ul>
<li>Try having a unique theme.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get timing right.
<ul>
<li>Skipping visible slides isn't great.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make the last slide the takeaway message instead of 'Thank you'.
<ul>
<li>This is the slide that should stay visible during Q&amp;A. Let the
message sink in.</li>
</ul></li>
