<p>2 parts, presented by David Malone.</p>
<p>Cantor How big is infinity</p>
<p>∞ + ∞ = ∞</p>
<p>Dbt:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can it be proved that PI has infinitely many decimal place numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>1768, the Swiss mathematician Johann Lambert showed that π has infinite decimal place numbers [1] Rational numbers have finite decimal expanison. Proof that π is irrational =&gt; infinite decimal expansion</p>
<p>ZF set theory is like a watered down version of set theory ??</p>
<p>Continuum hypothesis</p>
<ul>
<li>about possible sizes of infinite sets</li>
</ul>
<p>A psychologist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a way in which in order to understand something you have to llook very hard a t it. But you also have to be able to sort of move away from it and kind of see it in a kind of context. And the person who stares too hard can often lose that senese of context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boltzmann:</p>
<ul>
<li>S = k. log W</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Entroy is decay. And with decay, nothing lasts forever. … No order will last forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Goethe's Faust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring forth that is true Write it so its' clear Defend it to your last</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gödel's incompleteness theorem and Turing's halting problem are equivalent ??</p>

<h1 id="bbc-joy-of-logic">BBC: Joy of logic</h1>
<ul>
<li>This door must be kept closed at all times ??</li>
<li>This sentence is false.
<ul>
<li>Is this true?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The important thing to understand is that logic isn't knowledge. Logic doesn't create knowledge. What it does is it gives us cast-iron rules for how to organize and the handle knowledge. Even so the quality of the conclusions you get out depends on the quality of the ideas that you put in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently a quote from George Bernard Shaw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we commit no sin, we go to heaven. So, let’s all get drunk and go to heaven! -</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aristotle syllogism</p>
<ul>
<li>3 propositions</li>
<li>First 2 are the premises</li>
<li>Last one is the conclusion</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Socrates is mortal.
</code></pre>
<p>Examples of fallacies:</p>
<ul>
<li>All cats have four legs. My dog has four legs. Therefore my dog is a cat.</li>
<li>Something must be done. This is something. Therefore we must do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 256 kinds of syllogisms. But how did they figure that out?</p>
<p>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson aka Lewis Carol was a logician!! His books:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symbolic logic (original title might've been 'logic for ladies')</li>
<li>The game of logic</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mathematical analysis of logic</em> - George Boole (1947)</p>
<p><strong>Epimenides paradox</strong> Epimenides of Knossos said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All cretans are liars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Epimenides was a Cretan.</p>
<p>So was the statement true or false.</p>
<p>Self-referential.</p>
<p>Principia Mathematica is pronounced 'pinkipia mathematica'</p>
<p>Vienna circle.</p>
<p>Head of counter-espionage agency was a spy!</p>
<p>Gödel's incompleteness theorem.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you can have soundness or completeness. But not both.</p></li>
<li><p>If that's the case, it's like superposition in quantum mechanics.</p></li>
<li><p>Quote apparently by Ludwig Wittgenstein:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Logic takes care of itself; all we have to do is look and see how it does it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dave Cliff (presenter)</p>
<ul>
<li>Invented the ZIP trading algorithm</li>

<p>4 parts.</p>
<h2 id="part-4">Part 4</h2>
<p>Hilbert's 23 problems</p>
<p>Cantor: Continuum hypothesis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some infinities are larger than others</li>
<li>Question: Is there an infinity bigger than that of whole numbers but lesser than that of real numbers.</li>
<li>Solved by Paul Cohen.</li>
<li>Soln: 'Yes and no'</li>
</ul>
<p>7 bridges of Königsberg problem paved the way for the mathematical branch of topology. Euler proved that no such path could exist by the way.</p>
<p>Poincaré. French mathematician. A cousin once served as President of France.</p>
<p>Poincaré conjecture.</p>
<p>Hilbert Kurt Gödel</p>
<p>Gödel's incompleteness theorem: There willo</p>
<p>Presenter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think a mathematician is a pattern searcher. And that's really mathematicians try and do. We're trying to understand the patterns and the structure and the logic to explain the way the world around us works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Riemann hypothesis. Hilbert's 8th problem.</p>
