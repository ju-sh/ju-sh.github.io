<h2 id="whats-the-motivation">What's the motivation?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why are you doing this project?</li>
<li>What need does it solve?</li>
<li>What would change if this is implemented?</li>
<li>Who will benefit?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-you-intend-to-showcase-your-results">How do you intend to
showcase your results?</h2>
<p>Have a few example scenarios and work toward a solution to those
problems. Results can be showcased as solutions to that problem</p>
<hr />
<p>DBMS conflicts from log files? Critical section problem Concurrent
programs. Distributed systems</p>
<h2 id="focus-on-result-not-method">Focus on result not method</h2>
<p>When I was working on my project, I often got lost learning how to
use tools instead of figuring out how to use those tools for my problem.
Like learning tikz and metapost, when I had a presentation to make the
next day.</p>
<p>If you aim is to draw a picture, your focus should be on making that
picture, not on enusring that the pencil looks cool. Don't miss the
forest for the trees.</p>
<p>Tools are not important. Concepts are. It's the ideas that
matter.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="attitude-not-current-knowledge">Attitude not current
knowledge</h2>
<p>Often it's not the amount of knowledge that you posses but your
attitude that matters.</p>
